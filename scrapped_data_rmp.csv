45881,"Rand was a good guy, really... he was. But I felt he had an alter-ego when he left to go home and grade. His expectations and how he picked apart his students papers was simply not fair. Again, great guy but avoid this class with him!!!",awful
45881,"He is brilliant in his field, but expects his students to perform at high levels, with unrealistic expectations. Only by a miracle did I get an A, and that was after a heavy curve. He does care about his students though, as he gives lots of time in class for work, while he goes around giving tips and answering questions.",poor
45881,He has a major in philosophy which is why all the papers you have to write are based on philosophy. As long as your paper agrees with what he thinks you will get a good grade. Otherwise the class is boring and he talks for an hour about nonsense but it is mandatory to attend otherwise your grade will drop.,awful
45881,"I thought his class was extremely hard but despite it all, I became a confident writer. People on here say 'you can only get a c on a paper' WRONG. I got an A and a B. You just have to be in it to win it. If you want to get an A, get a different teacher. If you want learn, Go for Rand. He made Eng. 110 worth something.",good
45881,"I recently just finished taking Comp 110 with Rand and it was the hardest class of my freshman semester. He takes it way too serious for a 100 level class. 80% of the class is papers so you would think you control the grade you get, right? Wrong.  He will tear apart your paper and give you a bad grade despite your efforts. I worked hard for a C.",poor
45881,"Steven Rand is a nice person and really interesting to hear him speak. I am always inspired after a lecture. However, never expect to get anything higher than a C. You can think your paper is perfect but, he will tear it apart in seconds. Take a different professor if you don't want to put 9 hours of work into a paper you get an 'average' grade on.",good
45881,Hard class ,good
45881,He graded a 100 level class like we were all English majors in a 300 or above level class. Never got higher than a C on a paper. I went to the writing center for every paper. Very unclear in instructions and hard to approach with questions. Don't take the class from him.,awful
45881,Tough grader on papers make sure you do your work and drafts. Participation grades save you in the long run. Dont miss class and do your work. Go to the tutor center helps alot,poor
45881,Do not take English 110 with Rand. I don't feel any better at writing due to his confusing grading style. ,poor
45881,Bottom line Rand needs to retire before he ruins everyone's GPA's.  He thinks he knows so much about English and thinks it is his job to make essay assignments unneeded riddles.  He answers questions with questions and likes to talk trash about high school English teachers; hating on the high school teachers ironically makes it like high school. FR,awful
45881,He will only give your paper a C. It does not matter if it is good or not. Work extremely hard if you plan on passing.,good
45881,one of the worst professors at UND. Extremely hard grader and expects to much in a 100 level class. Thinks that everyone's papers should be masterpieces. No matter how long i spent on a paper i couldnt get higher than a C. Only reason i got a B in the class was because i never missed a class. ,awful
45881,"This class is so pointless its ridiculous.  I'm in the class currently (only because its required.) The class has no relevance to anything in life.  Rand is a ****, the class is so boring. He could make the class so much better by writing papers that actually have meaning to  them instead of what some philosopher said.  Textbook reading is hard!!  ",awful
45881,Horrible professor. He does not believe in A's.  Thinks that other teachers grade too easily.  Answers your questions with other questions that do not help you.  Teaches you irrelevant material that you will never use again. Worst professor I have ever had.,awful
45881,"Worst professor ever. He asked me personal questions that were uncomfortable, made me feel stupid when I asked questions, and overall discouraged me. Do not take english 125 from him.",awful
45881,"I attend his Business and Technical Writing course. Rand humiliates people for not understanding assignments when they ask. Very egotistical, rude to those who need help, very difficult work, hard grader -even on those who are following directions. I highly recommend waiting to take this class from anyone else. Not worth losing points on your GPA.",awful
45881,"He was a very hard grader, but he graded on improvement throughout the semester, not on how great of a  greater you were (I mean he obviously graded on how good of a writer you were, but it was more on how much you progressed). I learned a lot from him. I am even taking me next english class with him. Definitely take his course if you can!",awesome
45881,"Professor Steven Rand is very unclear and grades very hard. If you are in his English classes, drop if you want something less than a C. He hates that 'students were graded too easy in high school' so in response to that, he likes to fail his students.",poor
45881,"He is terrible! If you have him drop him IMMEDIATELY! He is mean, and an extremely hard grader!!!!",awful
45881,Awful. Horrible grading.,awful
45881,I wish I could give him a zero,awful
45881,Not good.,poor
45881,"This was a tough class. I expected all college classes to be like this, but since most are not it was somewhat refreshing to have a professor push me this much. If you are willing to put in the work for Mr. Rand you will reep the benefits. If not, then take this class from someone else.",awesome
45881,"He is a unruly professor. He grades on how he feels your ideas are. There is never a right answer, papers can ALWAYS use improvement. I would not recommend him to anyone wanting a grade over a C, even to get that you must put in an excessive amount of time into each paper.",poor
45881,"He is confusing in every aspect: in lecture, in assignments and in critiquing. His assignments are mundane and never change.  I expected to explore writing and become better.  He is an impossible grader, espcially because he grades on how HE feels about your ideas, not on grammer or content.  VERY DISAPPOINTING.",poor
45881,"Worst teacher I have had at UND. Sorry I don't have a PhD in English. His grading style is way too rough for a 125 class. nobody in my class has an A. I have put in 3x more hours for this class than any other but still this class is my worst grade. If possible, avoid this teacher!",poor
45881,worst experience of my life. expects way too much for a 100 level course. take this class if you want to spend 15 hours on a three page paper and still get a C-. ridiculous grading policies.,average
45881,"For as much of a waste as UNIV 101 is, he did an ok job at keeping things interesting.  Avoid UNIV 101 altogether if you can.",good
45881,"His expectations are high for a required 100-level class, especially since most who take it aren't English majors. To his credit, he's smart and gives good feedback. I wouldn't recommend him to a freshman.",good
45881,Steven rand just a joke!! and so incrediablely socially awkward! do not take this class unless you like to fail out of college! He gives you directions for a paper but grades on whatever is on his mind that day his grading makes no sense and no one has ever gotten an A in one of his classes yet.... if you dont believe me he will tell you this.,awful
45881,"I struggled through his class. First- he's a lawyer, so he'll lead you on making you think one thing without actually promising anything.  Second- he'll give you about 20 different instructions on one paper and he'll grade it by how he's feeling. Stupid class, I worked so hard and managed a B but he told me that I had &quot;weak writing.&quot; Avoid him!",awful
45881,"Hey be nice. Yeah, he's hard to understand, and a very harsh grader, but he's a teacher and at least he's doing his job (of course, everyone including me would love easier, more comprehendable classes) just be greatful he's willing to put up with everyone's bull hoping that he helped at least one student improve in literature.",good
45881,"Stevevn Rand was the absolute worst professor i have ever had.  He's without a doubt the hardest teacher you can take for any english classes.  He grades extremely hard, and not at the level of a 100 class. Also Steven Rand is the biggest &quot;Creeper&quot; he makes everyone around him feel extremely uncomfortable.",poor
45881,"This is the hardest 100 level class ever. It doesn't matter if you dedicate your life to this class, you still won't get an A! Take it a another semester or with a different professor. His directions are unclear. He goes against everything the book says, but tells you to use the book.  He's confusing, a hard grader, and a different guy. STAY AWAY!!",poor
45881,"I am currently in this class.  I took this, because I was told it was supposed to be easier than 120.  I regret staying in this class with Rand as my Professor.  He is nice and pretty smart, but his grading is ridiculous.  He is the hardest grader I have ever encountered.DONT take him, if you are taking this class as a general basically. LISTEN.",average
45881,"I took 125 because I heard it was easier than 120 unless you get a certain professor. Well this is that professor. He's a nice guy but expects perfection and is out of touch with reality. The class is boring and hard, and the book is expensive. First paper was 3-4 pages, last will be 15 with each in between getting larger. Would NOT recommend him.",poor
45881,This was by far the best learning experience I have had at UND. He is a hard grader but he helps by marking your papers with serious suggestions. I feel that many mistake his marks for personal attacks when he is only trying to bring the best out in his students. My writing skills have improved a hundred fold. I would recommend him to anyone.,awesome
45881,"I should have read these comments before I took this class. This was by far the worse teacher I have had! He makes you feel dumb and expects way to much for a 100 level class. Worked my butt off to get a B in the course! If you can, please switch to another teacher, you will be thankful you did!! He expects everyone is an English Major!",awful
45881,I suggest never taking him...i read the comments on here but figured it wouldnt be so bad so stayed in...wrong move...trust me..get out of the class ASAP...his instructions were never clear and he made you write the paper then changed his assignment my advice for the writers group is to just write a bunch of crap because you'll rewrite it anyway,awful
45881,No Comments,awful
45881,"horrible teacher, i had to transfer out of state i hated this guy so much",awful
45881,He was a very unfair teacher... i suggest NOT taking him!,awful
45881,IMPOSSILE!  If it is still possible to drop this class... DO IT!!  It is not possible to get above a C.  And to just get a C you have to work your butt off!,awful
45881,"I think he is a great guy to just talk about music, and fun stuff outside of school, but he never answers questions you have, and gives like a couple B's in the class the rest...  you know...",poor
45881,what can i say about rand....those of you who hate him so much should be lucky that you didn't have to endure his class five days a week for six weeks for an hour and a half each day....YOU SHOULD FEEL SOMEWHAT LUCKY!,awful
45881,This man is the devil trapped in human form. It is currently 2:42am the day before this final paper and I want to gouge my eyes out. If I could give some advice to future students I would recommend dropping at the soonest possible moment and save yourself some time before drop day or prepare to spend 8 hours writing papers to get a C-.I despise him,awful
45881,Impossible to a get above a C- on anything!!! He treats you like you are an employee of a Rocket science nasa program or something......Nice guy but a lil out of touch with reality,poor
45881,he sucks...and he wants you to fail at life...stay away.. far away...,awful
45881,"It is impossible to get a good grade.  If you get a B, congradulations, i think you're a first. he is an unfair grader.  I went to the writing center when he worked and had him look at my paper, made all the changes he told me to do and still go a C.  I spent way too much time on his papers.  If you have him, get out now!!!!!!",awful
45881,Never understood what was asking for because he never told you what he really wanted you to do. He's a total ****.,poor
45881,impossible to get a good grade,poor
45881,No Comments,poor
45881,"hes pretty tough, expects too much",good
45881,"He expects a lot from his students, but does take the time to get to know everyone.  I'd suggest going to the writing lab before you ask him for help..and he tends to suggest that too, or else be prepared for a lot of red ink.",average
45881,this guy is hard as nails.  all he did was whup my ass when I asked for help,awful
45881,He sucks,awful
45881,He Hated me .... never taught us how to write,awful

45881,Rediculous teacher...kills you on stupid details,poor
601915,"The course is difficult, but doable. Mr. Farm will help you, but the key to this course is to use  math learning center. He is a professor that wants to see you pass so he tries to help as much as possible.",good
601915,"Everyday there is a WebAssign assignment given out (very time consuming and they don't help you on the exams). The three exams he gives are extremely HARD!, all I can say is just practice ... a lot. I got a F on my first exam and had to ace the rest to get an A overall. lastly, the final will wreck you, the girl sitting next to me cried during it.",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is one of the nicest people you will meet. WebAssign assignments get handed out every day after class to practice problems and a quiz usually appears every day at class. Do a lot of practice questions for the 3 midterm tests. For the final he makes you understand the concepts instead of memorizing problems. Put the work in, get an A.",good
601915,"Tests are hard because they never matched up with notes and lectures. On the final test, we had to get a 70% on it or we didn't pass the Everything that you think is gonna be on the test, is not. Expect homework 4 days a week. Would not recommend.",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm is the best math teacher I have ever had. He is super funny and very passionate about what he does. There is a quiz almost every day in class, but it is not the end of the world if you miss one.",awesome
601915,Take this class with a different prof,awful
601915,He will answer all the questions you have. And he is willing to give his students a second chance to take passed due hw. Random in class quizzes is easy!,good
601915,Stuart is among the nicest professors I've ever had. Unfortunately this didn't translate into him being an effective one. Prepare for loads of homework and daily quizzes.,poor
601915,"If you take a class with Stuart Farm, be ready to spend A LOT of time outside of class on homework, often times teaching yourself unfortunately. Also, there is a quiz in class pretty much every day, so go! The homework is challenging and time consuming, but the tests are much easier which is nice. He isn't the best at explaining material, but ok.",average
601915,Terrible teacher all around. Had him my first year in college for math and got stuck with him again my junior year and nothing changed.. he maybe even got worse..,poor
601915,Nice person but absolutely sucks at teaching math. This class is supposed to be for students who are below the average math scores but he makes it so difficult. I'm bad at math to start with and he doesn't help. Avoid him at all costs.,awful
601915,"I took Math 92 and 93 in one semester, it was very fast paced. If you missed any class you would be behind for a while. All in all he was a good teacher, I think a lot of people didn't like moving at that pace and in turn disliked him.",average
601915,"Took this class for interest, also was the first math course in College. It was very hard to start with, extensive and new HW every class(Webassign), Prepare to do them, with solid understanding. attendence are vital. Test are very based on in class assignments and lecture examples.",good
601915,"Farm has homework almost nightly, but it nothing that wasn't able to be done quickly for the most part.  His final test accounted for the most percentage of the points in the class so studying is mandatory if you want to pass this class.",good
601915,"If you don't show your work or show that you double checked your answers he'll give you a zero, even if you got the question right.  Also you can't skip because he does in class practice that you turn in at the end of the class.",awful
601915,Very Nice guy. very willing to help,average
601915,"Mr. Farm is the nicest man you will ever meet. His concepts are easy to figure out. As long as you pay attention and show up, you will be fine.",good
601915,Kinda quirky but he's a good guy that cares. Show up everyday for free points. Quizzes almost every week (turned into group quizzes by the end of the semester). Test very similar to quizzes. Homework almost every day and it is much harder than what you will see on the quizzes/test though if you ask for extensions you'll get it every time. Math On!,awesome
601915,"Kind of weird, makes corny jokes all the time but one of the better math professors I've had. He's passionate about the subject and it shows. He spends extra time making sure that his students understand the reasons behind why you do certain steps and, for me, it was helpful in my understanding. Recommended.",good
601915,"This class is  a giant headache. So far, we've had over 30 assignments(only worth 20% of grade) that each take hours to complete, because Stuart puts many problems that we never went over in class . On top of that, we have weekly comprehensive quizzes that are inconsistent in difficulty and points. Simply, I pity anyone who has to take this class.",poor
601915,I would not recommend this professor if you' re not strong in math. You should expect to do homework almost every night. New homework assignment after each class. Doesn't give traditional exams but weekly quizzes for points. Text book assigned was of little help. Homework take hours to complete for only small portion of grade.,average
601915,"Stuart Farm, so far, has been the worst professor I have had. He grades so harshly that it is almost impossible to get even a C. (At one point I had a 48%) (& Im the average A/B student) He gives weekly quizzes and gives time consuming homework. I would not recommend him.",poor
601915,"He is the worst teacher that I have had for the past ten years. He goes way overboard with trying to explain things, and when he does explain things, it doesn't show up on the test or quizzes. There are many other students in my class that have no idea what is going on. Don't take any of his classes. You have to teach yourself the lessons.",poor
601915,Stuart Farm is a fantastic guy that is very easy to get along with. Greets you with a smile every day and is excited to see you each and every day and tries to make the class fun. Defenitly introduce yourself to him. He is confusing in his explaining of concepts. He tends to over-explain where it gets confusing. He is a very respectable person.,average
601915,"Stuart Farm is a nice guy and cares about his students, but that doesn't result in effective teaching or keeping the class engaged. He doesn't seem to understand that students taking Math146 are the least likely to raise there hand and contribute, and you can't have a discussion with 100 people. For grades, watch him like a hawk and email him ASAP.",poor
601915,"Mr. Farm is a good teacher, but is not quite clear on the types of questions we need to go over. The homework and in-class assignments are a lot tougher than the actual exams.",good
601915,"Mr. Farm was a nice guy and tried to make everyone laugh. But points wise I had an A, because of his curve I had a C. He never explained anything and if you asked him a question he never seemed to answer it. I would avoid taking his class, unless you want to fail. ",poor
601915,"Professor Farm is a nice guy and wants you to do well, but he is very confusing. Avoid him if possible. I took Math93 with him, and although it's very simple math, he makes if somehow difficult. I hadn't had math since my junior year of high school, so I had to take this. His explanations make things more difficult. Have to teach yourself. ",average
601915,"His class was not too bad, but he tries very hard to get the attention of his students by cracking corny jokes. I skipped class most of the time, and did not miss much. ",average
601915,"Gives easy examples in class when teaching, then when it comes to web assign homework its harder stuff that he never taught, only teaches the basic examples and expects you to take it from there on your own.",awful
601915,"Open a new tab, go on Campus Connection and change to a different calc 147 class with a different teacher. RIGHT NOW.  Trust me and everyone else on here who has taken this class. Gave me multiple zero's on test problems for not doing the question 'his way' even thought the answer was correct. ",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm knows math and he wants you to learn.  Don't expect him to just give you the answers. He will answer any and every question and clarify anything you need.  Attend class, do the assignments and you'll do fine.  Gives 2 tests (10 questions each) and final (15 questions). Super nice, nerdy guy who's motto is 'Math on!' ",good
601915,"Terrible at teaching, absolutely no help when asking questions, and was rude to his own students.",awful
601915,"Mr. Farm is in the top 3 of the worst teachers I have ever had. He assigns work that you did not cover on web assign (the worst way to do math homework). He is not very helpful, and is very odd. Avoid this professor at all costs, he will make an easy subject hard to comprehend.",awful
601915,"Like others have said, he seems like a great guy, and is very willing to help his students.  That said, he spends most of every lecture period answering questions from current or previous assignments and then only lectures on new material for 10 min.  So I basically have had to teach myself the material which makes it super tough and time consuming",average
601915,"Is a very nice teacher, but hard to understand his lectures. He expects you to know too much coming into the class, and goes far over the students head's while lecturing. WebAssign assignments are long and hard as he doesn't go over any of it in class. Lots of out of class homework. ",awful
601915,"Seems like a nice guy, but he expects you to know calculus coming into the class and doesn't give much for notes. ",average
601915,"Annoying, not helpful. Incredibly unclear.",poor
601915,  He tries his best to make sure everyone gets the help they need.  He tries to make lecture fun. He gives a lot of homework but will extend deadline to the amount of time you need to get done.  He is a good guy.,awesome
601915,The amount of homework is absolutely ridiculous and he doesn't explain anything very well in calss,poor
601915,I got an A in my high school precalc class. I decided to retake this after being out of school for nearly 2 years. I only managed a D in this class. I could not understand anything he was teaching. My girlfriend didn't even know and she was in calc 2. Over taught everything beyond most of the class' knowledge. ,poor
601915,Mr. Farm is hands down just not clear in any area of the classes he teaches. It seems that there is about a 5050 split between students who get what he is teaching and those who don't. I would not recommend taking a class with him.,poor
601915,Farm makes college algebra into rocket science. He makes solving and explaining every problem way harder than it needs to be and never clearly outlines the steps. His tests are way harder than the homework and there is a 'learning tool' a.k.a. a quiz everyday in class. STAY AWAY! You'll regret taking this class and you don't even get credit for it.,poor
601915,"Mr. Farm was always willing to help, he just requires you put in the work.  I was never a fan of math until I took his class. You can ask him fifty questions and he will do his best to answer you. Depending on the class he does lots of assignments or little quizes. I would highly recommend him. Attendance is not required but helps a lot!",awesome
601915,"Taught as if we already knew what he was teaching. Did not notice when the class was really confused. Very nice guy, total geek which made him so likeable.",poor
601915,"I only went to class the first day and the days of the tests and passed.  It is possible to not attend and pass if you just look in the book and practice a few problems before the tests. After all, attendance is not taken and you get no credits for taking math 102.",average
601915,"This guy is genuinely there for his students and is willing to help.  I ended the class with 101% in the class, so getting an A isn't an impossible feat.. I suggest doing the all assignments, the study guides, and getting Calc. for dummies, which was a HUGE help for me. DON'T GET THE TEXTBOOK, I NEVER USED IT. PRACTICALLY WORTHLESS.",good
601915,"The class is difficult, so you will not pass by just attending class and expecting to absorb the information. If you don't put in effort outside of class then you are preparing to fail. Stuart is sometimes hard to follow, but he offers many opportunities to seek help, and he cares about his students. Even though he is goofy, he's a really good guy.",good
601915,Stuart Farm wonders off subject more than he teaches and he tries to drag on and over explain things that we already know about. ,awful
601915,I think that the people going on here and posting good things about this class is Farm himself. As a senior I was just looking at what people are saying about the worst professor ever here at UND.  I had a horrible time in this class and I would never want anyone to have to take a class with him. He should never be allowed to teach here. ,awful
601915,Mr. Farm is one of my least favorite professors. The problems he shows us in class are completely different from the web-assigns. This whole semester I have been teaching myself how to do everything. Would not recommend!!!  ,poor
601915,"He might not be the clearest lecturer in the world but he is the absolute BEST one-on-one teacher I had in my four years at UND.  He's so encouraging and genuinely wants his students to do well.  If you're not willing to spend time on the homework & go to his office hours then you probably won't get a good grade, but that's your own fault.",good
601915,"Hardest class I've ever taken.  Web assign assignments took me hours to complete because I had to teach myself the stuff that he was supposed to teach me.  Boring lectures and hard tests.  His favorite saying is 'math on!' so just from that you can imagine that he is a complete nerd, although he is nice.  ",poor
601915,"Literally the worst. Funny/dry humor, but he will not work with you.",poor
601915,"Extremely difficult class, but a requirement. That being said, even with all the bad reviews Farm knows what he's doing. His classes are difficult to follow and I wouldnt have passed with just attendance. He was available whenever I needed to ask him questions, and once responded to an email of mine at 4:30am. Dont know if I would pass without him",good
601915,The review sheets he gives you before hand are much easier than the questions on the test.  You will think you are prepared and then you'll get stumped by trick questions.,poor
601915,"Mr farm is a really nice guy but he is a very hard teacher. He takes the majority of class time showing you how to get a FORMULA. then there is only a short time to learn how to use the actual formula. I got A's on all my maths tests in highschool, out of four this year i got one B and the rest are lower then that. good luckk.",awesome
601915,Very Helpful and Easy to get help from. Tests are kind of hard but he gives you review sheets. Overall good teacher,awesome
601915,"He is the absolute worst teacher that I have ever had.  The lectures are very confusing, but the homework is pretty easy.  The stuff on the homework is no where to be found on the tests and when you get the test it seems like its all totally new information.  He is very nice and willing to help, but it doesn't make up for how bad of a teacher he is",average
601915,Well... All I can say I that I showed up to every one of this guys class and I still somehow pulled a C out of nowhere... Thinks he is funny and tests are hard.. In class work has nothing to do with Web Assign homework.... GOOD LUCK,poor
601915,"He's so sweet, but not a professor I would recommend. You will never, ever use the book, so don't buy it. His exams are basically trick questions from all the sections, and he's looking for perfection. He's a hard grader and in my opinion, unfair.",poor
601915,"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID. (Applied Calc. 146) Farm is a nice guy overall, but is an absolutely terrible professor. His lectures are almost useless for the homework assignments,and his tests seem to be completely random things that are not covered well in class or the study guides. Plus, he grades very hard.",awful
601915,Farm is a nice guy. The problem is what he goes over in class and then what the assignments look like are two different things. If you don't want to be frustrated and feeling lost all the time avoid him at all cost's,poor
601915,He is a very nice guy. Alot of people do not like him because of his grading but if you go in for help he will help you! Also the online homework is very easy and will help. He is a very nice man!,awesome
601915,"This guy lectures well but he is so soft spoken that it is imperative to sit right in front to hear him properly. The online homework took me a long time since I was new to Calculus, but it is the best way to learn the material. At one point he provided evidence to support Noah's flood and Earth's age which was a misuse of his position.",good
601915,"He tries to crack jokes during class form time to time, some funny some others not so. His notes are a little random and not so in-depth, but he is very willing to work with you in and out side of class! Don't be afraid to ask questions!!! His tests can be easy if you study and they are not take home tests!",average
601915,Dorky at times but a good teacher,good
601915,"Stuart Farm was a nice enough guy, but that gets you nowhere with teaching. His lectures are all over the place and do not relate to the online assignments at all. His lectures are scattered, covering things randomly and unevenly, and he goes through material way too fast. I would not recommend him as a teacher.",poor
601915,"I get an absolute kick out of this guy in class! He has such a weird sense of humor, but it is still funny as heck! But on another note, he isn't really that good of a teacher. Doesn't do examples in class that help with homework, and pretty much told us that we will not need our book at all, which sucks because of how much the book costs. =/",average
601915,Lectures had nothing to do with the online assignments.  Notes were not helpful at all.  Basically taking a class with no teacher. Probably better off just trying to learn from the book and skipping class.  Switched sections after week and a half,poor
601915,"I've only been in his class for a week and I hate it! I used to love going to math class he just makes it frustrating! Lectures have nothing to do with online assignments, his notes don't even make sense, and he doesn't put any examples into action so your always clueless! Goes through things way to fast as well! Waste of my hard earned money!",poor
601915,"I really like Stuart as a person, but not as a teacher. His lectures were a lot different than the homework and the notes weren't very useful. He is hard to follow, but he will make time outside of class if extra help is needed.",average
601915,"He is a really nice guy and is willing to answer any questions, but he is terrible at teaching lectures!! The reason why I always needed to ask for help is because he would never really show how to do the problems. He went way too fast, even though he says he'll slow it down until people understand. Very frustrating!!",average
601915,"While he was very enthusiastic about Math, (which I appreciated), he was also very insistent that everyone understood everything quickly, without time to really practice what we had just learned. Disappointing when he knew over half of the class was going to fail, then didn't bother to help.",average
601915,"Horrible, he explains math and compares it to Star Wars. Tries to explain things too fast and he is just not understandable.",awful
601915,Very hard to understand.  Would NOT reccomend him unless you are good at teaching yourself.  I went to class everyday and still did not understand it because he does not teach good.,awful
601915,"I thought Mr. Farm was an excellent PreCalculus instructor.  One of the best math teachers I've had.  He does a great job at explaining the concepts and providing examples on the blackboard.  Also, I thought he was mildly entertaining and has a friendly demeanor, which never hurts.",awesome
601915,Wonderful teacher in office hours but terrible in class. I believe the chalk board learned more than anyone in the class.,average
601915,"HE TRYS HARD TO HELP AND TEACH US, BUT. HIS WAY OF EXPAINING THINGS IS,..... UNCLEAR AND HARD TO FOLLOW. I BELIVE THE ONLY WAY TO UNDERSTAND MR. FARM IS TO HAVE PREVIOUSLY TAKEN THIS CLASS WITH A DIFFRENT PROFESSOR",average
601915,"cannot get his point across, is very confusing, puts all the trick questions on the tests and makes it difficult for students.Would not recommended him to any one.",poor
601915,He is very helpful if you don't understand the topic. Sometimes the tests can be tricky but if you go in for his office hours he is more than happy to explain the concepts for you.,awesome
601915,TERRIBLE. Absolutley hated his class. He just assumes everyone understands the information and never asks if you actually get it or not. Also he moves really fast through the material which can be a bad thing when he sucks at teaching it.,poor
601915,Avoid! At the start of the semester I looked at this site on him and it was a 1.9 I didn't think much of it I figured just as long as I show up to class and do the work I will do fine. Well I did all of that and I studied many many hours before tests and it never paid off. What Im trying to say is that Farm makes the class harder than it should be.,poor
601915,"Along with everyone else, he's the worst teacher I have ever had. He pretty much just talks to himself the whole period and doesn't ask if anyone gets it. He sometimes talks to period marks on the board. The most awkward guy I know!",awful
601915,"If you're looking to understand math, do not take it with farm.",poor
601915,i would give this teacher a .8,poor

601915,"This guy is terrible he teaches the class harder than its supposed to be. Your better off paying the $600 bucks and taking it online. Do not take him at all. Trust me if you want to pass, he is not the guy. He just rambles on and doesn't stop to explain things. I highly advise you not to listen to the comments from nerds saying how good he is.",awful
601915,"Best math teacher I've ever had.  He's really helpful and accomodating.  Hes also really easy to talk to, dont hesitate to go talk to him about problems on a test.  If you go to class regularly, take notes and DO the homework, there is absolutly no reason you shouldnt get an A.",awesome
601915,Terrible teacher. I will not ever take a class from him again. his grading is so unfair. dont ever think you can take a class and get a grade you deserve from farm,poor
601915,worst teacher ever. i took this class before. i know everything we go over. i teach about 10 other students in the class cause they don't know whats going on yet when the test come around. impossible. the average test grades for the class are 61%,awful
601915,I would not wish this teacher on anyone!,awful
601915,Worst teacher I have ever had! He cannot teach whatsoever and his grading is really unfair. If you are signed up for his class switch to someone else asap.,awful
601915,for those who struggle at all with math...dont take a class from farm.  He teaches by showing the most complicated problem first then works backward...very difficult to learn anything from his lectures.,poor
601915,"Worst teacher I have ever had my whole entire life!He cant teach at all.I went in for extra help,which was the most useless wasted hours of my life.His tests are rediculous-no partial credit given.You either get the 5 points or you get none. How can a question be worth 5 points, and if you get it wrong, you get none&#63;Where do the 5 points come from&#63;",awful

601915,No Comments,poor
601915,"Although nice, and somewhat approachable, his teaching methods are very hard to learn from. He also gives extremely long and hard exams, which most of the class fails. The class average four our first exam was an F. I would not recommend this class for anyone who wants a good grade, or has a hard time teaching themselves math.",poor
601915,I don't see why everyone has such a problem with him.  I like his teaching style and you learn quite a bit from it.  Take the class from him if you actually want to learn and not fall behind for the next Calc class.  He's helpful and accomodating after class also..,good

601915,the whole class failed the first test.. hes a great guy but his teaching method is not the best.. i hardly understood anything,poor
601915,Avoid this guy at all costs. I have taken several math classes in college and have never gotten below a B. I had to drop this class becuase I had an average of 40%. Extremely hard tests. He said his tests are a measure of real life therefore he dosen't curve. So does this mean that the average person is failing in life like they are on his tests&#63;,awful
601915,had him first sem. my freshman year and he was really hard.  His method of teaching is hard to understand and I dislike having the whole grade based on tests.,poor
601915,No Comments,awful
601915,Took this class last year.  Caught a mathematical error that he made that drastically changed the steps to take to solve the problem and the solution to the problem itself.  He fought me on it regardless of substantially proving he was wrong.  Next class period he taught it correctly how I had shown.,awful

601915,"Not a bad teacher, although I did not enjoy the lame jokes and teaching style. I never went to the class and passed, 102 being a pass fail class saved me. no need to attend class because he never gives pop quizes as long as you study hard on your own. I learned more through the book",average
601915,"Mr. Farm keeps your interest with his funny gestures and wierd Math jokes. But, please, study real hard because if your class is in an auditorium of 100 people like mine was you will not learn as much.",average
71357,"I would not consider this class a sociology class. This felt more like just information on drugs and did not talk about it sociologically. It was still a good class, a lot harder than any other class by Frank White. Online quizzes for every test which are easy. You cannot skip this class ever.",good
71357,Great professor! Manages to entertain a whole lecture hall when he teaches. Hilarious and will always keep your attention.,awesome
71357,"Frank's easily one of the best professors at UND and goes out of his way to get to know his students. Knows all the course content extremely well, and keeps you engaged the whole time. Some of his stories are awesome. Do the memory matrices, crosswords, and study guides and you'll easily pass. Go to class because his powerpoints are fill in.",awesome
71357,"Frank is easily one of the most knowledgeable professors at UND. He's also incredibly likable and approachable, and his lectures are genuinely interesting.",awesome

71357,"Frank White is the BEST professor at UND. He can turn the most boring topic into something that you're literally on the edge of your seat to hear. He's extremely knowledgeable and up-to-date on his material, genuinely cares about his students, and takes the time to get to know them. He's got a great sense of humor  and is well respected by everyone",awesome
71357,"Great class, great teacher. He does use power points now. Either use your computer to fill in the notes or print out the power points and bring them to class to fill in the rest of the lecture notes.",awesome
71357,"Interesting and entertaining.  Instructor makes this class a pleasure and is very high energy.  He was always willing to answer questions and provide assistance and was happy to have engaged students.  Even if you aren't a SOC major, take this class!",awesome
71357,"Funny, interesting, and helpful! Definitely recommend Dr. White! He gets to know his students (which is amazing that he knows so many in such a large lecture) and enjoys what he does!",awesome
71357,"Frank is one of the best teachers at UND. It's sad that he's now done with the big lecture classes, because otherwise I'd highly recommend you take them. Intro to Soc. was extremely easy anyway, but he made going to class fun and that made the class awesome.",awesome
71357,Most interesting prof. I've ever had. Even if you're not interested in the material his lectures will get you listening. Attendance is pretty much required with easy daily quizzes but it was honestly never a struggle to convince myself to go to this class. Definitely take at least one class from him.,awesome
71357,He's such an awesome professor. He has passion for what he teaches and makes things interesting to us. He uses funny examples all the time that are sure to get a laugh out of you. I HIGHLY recommend taking this class from him.,good
71357,"Frank is by far one of the best teachers at UND. Lectures are very entertaining, and he has a fun sense of humor and great story-telling ability. Posts online memory matrices, review information, and a lecture outline to guide students. Highly recommend taking the class.",awesome
71357,Frank White was a great professor! I looked forward to going to class because Frank was funny and outgoing during lectures and passionate toward what he was teaching. The tests were not to bad as long as you went to class and studied for them.,awesome
71357,"One of the best teachers i've ever had, all his classes are lecture based, he has a funny story for every topic he is talking about. Made coming to class fun. Highly recommended",awesome
71357,"Such a great professor.  He made and effort to get to know me personally.  Also, he makes class very interesting.  He talks about personal stories to help you understand the material.",awesome
71357,"AMAZING professor. He is the reason I switched my major to Sociology. Always attend class because he does not put notes online. If you can, bring your laptop for notes. He jumps around a lot and fills in things he missed during his lecture so it's easiest to use your computer and he doesn't use powerpoint.",awesome
71357,"Very interesting, has stories for everything. Doesn't use powerpoint which makes class much more interactive but make sure to take notes because most of the exam is based off of class. Best professor I've had at UND and very approachable",awesome
71357,"He was a great professor! If you take the time to talk to him and get to know him it will benefit you in the end.  Go to class though and pay attention, he doesn't put the notes online and he talks really fast! But overall he makes class interesting!",awesome
71357,Frank is the best professor I've had. If you go to class and take the notes (he doesn't put them on powerpoint) it's an easy A. He tells funny stories and makes class really interesting.,good
71357,Very entertaining.  Keeps you engaged! He connects things to real world stuff so it's easy to understand which makes the tests easy!,awesome
71357,EXCELLENT teacher. if you are taking sociology take it from him. He is very funny and entertaining. you have to attend class or you wont have the notes for the tests which are 70% off of lecture notes. the other 30% is from the book which you have to read. he gives a study guide which is very helpful.,awesome
71357,"He is definitely the best professor I have had so far. He is really funny and personable and makes the class interesting. But, you need to go to class to get the notes because he doesnt put them up on blackboard and most of the test is based off lecture. Easy A if you go.",awesome
71357,"helpful , made the class interesting",awesome
71357,he is the best teacher I have had at UND so far. he loves his job and wants you to learn. there is never a bad lecture.,awesome
71357,"Very passionate in his lecture, and likes to make the class laugh.  he always talks to people before class starts just to see how their day is going.  The only negative is that he does not use powerpoints so you have to write everything down.  He talks very fast too, so either learn how to type/write quickly.",good
71357,Good teacher but my only complaints are he doesnt use powerpoint slides or post notes on blackboard so you have to write down everything he says and he talks fast & rambles a lot.Make friends in the class because if you miss a day you will need to get the notes from them or else you won't do that well on the tests. Do the study guides as well.,awesome
71357,"By far the best professor at UND. He is so passionate about his students and his career.  Going to class was always a blast, and almost every seat was always filled.",awesome
71357,lectures are very interesting and helpful in understanding textbook,awesome
71357,Hilarious and very interesting! I love this class and White really knows his stuff. Every lecture is entertaining. Labs are pointless though,awesome
71357,THIS GUY IS HILARIOUS AND DEFINATELY KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. BY FAR THE BEST SOCIOLOGY TEACHER AND IS VERY EASY AND FUN TO LISTEN TO,good
71357,I had this guy for a professor some years ago and I remember him doing a fantastic job.  His lectures were smooth and fast moving as he demonstrated an outstanding grasp of the material.  Easily one of the top three professors I've encountered in my college time.,awesome
71357,AWESOME LECTURER! totally hilarious and keeps your attention guaranteed.  His classes are kind of random facts thrown together but review sheets help extremely on tests.  TA's are either awesome or insanely stuck up.... so beware. Lab homework is tedious but very easy.,awesome
71357,One of the best professors at UND.  His lectures are humorous; not boring or &quot;death by power point.&quot;,good
71357,"Far and away the best Prof at UND. Funny as hell, great teacher, and cares for his students. Sometimes his class is like watching a stand-up comic.  Take any class you can, you will not regret it.",awesome
71357,Frank's lectures are very interesting and they are also very easy to understand.  He also makes learning easy  by connecting stories to his lectures.,awesome
71357,"AWESOME teacher.  Very dynamic and makes the class very interesting.  I would take another class I don't find interesting at all, as long as he teaches it because he's such a great teacher.",awesome
71357,Such a funny class!  Cant get over the accent.  His stories are so damn funny and they help you relate real life with the course teachings.  Take anything with this teacher,awesome
71357,"Frank is easily the best teacher I've had in my 3 years of college.  He really does seem to enjoy teaching and seems like a very genuinely caring guy.  Anyone looking to take this course, rest assured that you have an excellent professor in charge.  Again, one of the best teachers UND has.",awesome

71357,"Frank has a way with the students, he is not just there because thats what he is suppose to do but I believe that he has passion in what he does which brings excitement to his class. Love the stories, they help me relate, when I study for his class it is so much easier when I have the stories to remember and fall back on.",awesome
71357,"frank white is my favorite professor, his attitude and energy is amazing. his class is one of the only classes i look forward too.",awesome

71357,"Very lousy teacher.  His stories rambled and were annoying.  He could have crammed what took him and hour to say into 30 seconds.  I stopped going after the first 3 weeks, and still pulled an A.  I guess he wasn't really needed.  They should get rid of him.",awful
71357,"Awesome teacher. He's one of the few teachers whose lectures I can actually pay attention to. I'll go into the class dog tired but come out completely energized. Very funny, knowledgeable guy.",awesome

71357,Shares applicable stories in class to relate to material. . .entertaining!!,awesome
277557,"This has by far been the hardest thing I have ever done in my life but it is SO worth it. The class is time consuming and a good grade doesn't come easy. You have to be determined and have to put a lot of time and effort into the course, but Dr. Shively isn't out to make people fail, he wants you to pass, you just have to READ the Q's.",good
277557,"Shively is the man. He really knows his stuff. This class with the lab was easily the hardest course I've ever taken. If you aren't constantly reading the chapters, spending a couple of nights a week in lab you're not going to get an A. That being said it is possible. Super funny guy, really cares about his students, but he'll make you work for it.",good
277557,"Dr. Shively is the best professor I've ever had. He helped me to UNDERSTAND and LOVE the material rather than just memorize it. He is willing to work with you outside of class and he cares about your success. This course is the tough and requires a lot of effort. But if you are willing to work REALLY hard and put in the hours, an A is possible!",awesome
277557,"His tests suck! They are super unclear and you end up trying to read his mind. 'How many straight sections of the colon?' Could be 2 or 3 depending on his thoughts.  He is a veterinary science guy, not an intro to anatomy. He might be better at higher level anatomy classes, but not for an intro class. He likes to show off how smart he is.",poor
277557,"If you have to take Anatomy, take it from Shively! He's honestly the best lecture teacher available. He has funny stories he'll tell and he loves it when students ask questions. This is a very hard class but I could tell Shively wanted his students to succeed, he just expects you to use your brain and actually do the work and reading!!",good
277557,"The amount of work and time spent needed to even pass, and probably for the second go around, is not equal to the 4 credits earned.  Take Anatomy somewhere else!  Many students take all other needed classes and then transfer to BYU or SLCC to take Anatomy to keep their good GPA to be accepted to the desired program.",awful
277557,"I enjoyed Dr Shively, but this class is a little ridiculous.  The anatomy department acts like their class is a gift from the gods. I am in nursing school now and am annoyed that the correct anatomical terms I spent so much time learning in this class aren't used in the medical field - I have to learn the 'improper' terms used in the real world.",good
277557,"This teacher is horrible. His lectures don't really help with what you need to know in order to get a good grade. His tests are made to make you fail. I went to class every time, studied my butt off, and talked to him about what I can do to get a better grade and still didn't succeed.",awful
277557,"Definitely not the greatest teacher. Rude and was bad at teaching the subject, you'll learn more from the textbook than him.",awful
277557,Memorize the entire textbook. Even then the questions on the test are obscure. I would say not to take too many credits while taking this class. Usually the labs are supplements to the lecture but in the lab you also have to memorize the other textbook. Even if you take from an easier teacher all the anatomy courses are structured the same.,average
277557,His tests for the intro to anatomy and physiology class were ridiculously hard. He gives you a study guide but that doesn't really help you. His multiple choice tests are A-F sometimes A-J. After the second test with a  class  average of 50% or lower it really discouraged people to even try. His questions are tricky and sometimes out of context.,poor
277557,"Shively taught me so much, I am so grateful I took his class. When students didn't understand, he explained the material another way. Memorize the textbook!!! He will try to help you succeed as long as you want it enough to keep trying. There is a lot of material, but I passed even though I had a concussion this semester. You can do it!",awesome
277557,"Dr. Shively is the best professor I've ever had. His class is almost impossibly hard, but he designs it that way on purpose. If you go to him for help, he won't just 'help you out' by giving you good grades, but he will do everything he can to help you really learn anatomy. He's also one of the kindest and most hilarious people I've ever met.",awesome
277557,"Like everyone else on here has said, Shively's class is HARD. He knows everything there is to know about Anatomy, and nearly expects you to also in a very short amount of time. You HAVE to go to class, and should study every day, use every resource available. The curve saved me in his class, thankfully. But seriously, be prepared to study HARD.",average
277557,"UVU offers a mind-reading class, it should be a prerequisite for taking any class from Shively. He's an arrogant man who uses his classes to prove how smart he is, not as a way to educate students. The labs are awesome and the lab staff but Shively's direction of the class, lectures and attitude are beyond ridiculous.",awful
277557,"Dr. Shively is hilarious and I honestly loved his class. However it was seriously one of the hardest things I've ever done (because of the course material, not the teacher).  Lots of reading, and the tests were very tricky (but the whole anatomy department uses the same tests). The expected averages were in the 50's and 60's (the curve is magical).",good

He is a nice guy and always answers my questions. It's a hard class but it needs to be. If you're not good at spelling, get good at it before taking this class from anyone at UVU.",good
277557,Dr. Shively is a great teacher.  He has lectures that he has filmed that are available online.  They were extremely helpful.   I liked that he broke things down in a simple way so I could understand. His tests were really hard. He will tell u whats on the test. The learning objectives packet will be your saving grace when it comes to studying.,good
277557,He just has a memorized lecture and gives it the same every time. If you ask questions he is rude and you can't read his hand writing or the board in Pope science buliding . He acts if using a projector would kill him. If you can't see the board that is a problem!! also he doesn't do what he says he is going to do!! BAD!,awful
277557,"Exceptionally smart, very high expectations. Sometimes it felt like he had a hard time bringing his level of knowledge down to us just learning Anatomy. Don't even think about skipping class. Read like your life depends on it. He adjusts at the end of the semester, try your best to stay above the class average, which is surprisingly hard to do...",poor
277557,"Dr. Shively is a hilarious genius, but in my opinion, not the best teacher.  I enjoyed going to class for the sole purpose of observing his personality, but most of the time I spent wondering what I was paying for.  He wrote the book on anatomy (literally) and if you take this class at UVU, your ONLY option is to know it inside and out. GOOD LUCK!",poor
277557,"Dr. Shively is not a teacher--he's a lecturer. Don't go to class expecting him to teach you new material. He's expecting you to show up already knowing the material, and then you can talk about it during class. He's a great guy and super hilarious. Much more approachable than Don, although Don is a better 'teacher'. I re-toke this class from Don. ",average
277557,"Soooooo read the chapter, but like 100 times. His test questions are just worded weird... and it doesnt help when he writes the freaking tests in his cursive handwriting..... he doesnt test you on the obvious, but tests you on things you might skip or pass up. Read all small print under pictures. Understand how all terms and concepts work together.",average
277557,"It's actually a 9 hour a week class that you only get 4 credit hours for (3 in lecture + 1 in testing center + 3  in lab + 2 in open lab required for STA to sign off on your hw  9 hrs). If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea don't take it. The students who pass this class plan ahead and don't take a full semester load, the rest fail. ",poor
277557,"Yes, the tests are hard, it's a lot of work, but it's the most rewarding class ever. Shively is GREAT in lecture because he gives you simple definitions. The best textbook I've ever had. Grading is rough, but you'll understand why. He lets you know what you do need to know and in how much detail. He comes off scary but he's hilarious & very sweet. ",good
277557,"Doesn't care if students are successful, only wants to show everybody how smart he is. Class was a waste of time, and tests had trick questions so even if you know the material you have to know how he thinks to get correct answers. Bad experience, he is giving UVU a bad rep. This instructor is not teaching to help the students succeed, bad instruct",awful
277557,"Dr. Shively takes pleasure in having the most ridiculously difficult class on campus, this class should be worth 12 credit hours at least. I got an A, so I am not just a jaded student who got his GPA wrecked. His giant ego is second only to that of his minion TA's who love to scare current students to death. Switch Universities before taking this. ",awful
277557,"I hated this class!  Shively has a LOT of knowledge on the subject, which is great but without recording the class or having a photographic memory there is no way you will pass. His tests are ridiculously tricky and you basically just have to guess. Oh wait even if you do he will mark you wrong on every test.... EVEN If you are right!  ",poor
277557,"Awesome class! Prepares you well for med school. Those who bag on this class obviously don't try hard enough to pass. Shively was a great professor, so funny and willing to help you out and clarify  concepts. Such a great class, lab was so fun!",awesome
277557,"Shively was a really good teacher, but his tests were brutal. He changed his style of tests constantly, which meant a surprise.",average
277557,Very difficult class. Shively know what he's talking about and teaches to show off his knowledge. Tests are incredibly hard and very tricky. He doesn't test your knowledge - he tests your guessing ability. ,poor
277557, Shively and his minions (lab instructors and STA's) are more interested in furthering their ego than teaching.  Worst educators I've ever experienced.  This entire class was a complete waste of time and money.  Take from another University if you don't want to ruin your GPA or plan on getting into graduate school.,awful
277557,"Shively's Intro to Anatomy class kinda felt more like an Intro Med School class. People on here are not kidding when they say it's difficult! You NEED the textbook to pass. All I can say is STUDY STUDY STUDY. If you do poorly on one test (of his five or so) he will let you replace one with the final. Go to class, read your notes, read the text. ",good
277557,Shively is a nice guy but is not very organized or structured. You pretty much just show up to class to ask him questions. Just ready the book thoroughly and memorize the objectives. Very time consuming class and tests and final are difficult.,average
277557,"Shively is a unique fellow. I like him. He knows what he's talking about. He wrote the book on anatomy, literally.  The textbook anyway. The subject is tough, there is a lot to learn. He won't dumb it down, so if you're not putting in enough effort you won't pass the class. Shively does do his best to motivate his students and help them understand",good
277557,"Michael Shively seems to know a great deal about the study of Anatomy. This being said, he is the worst professor I have ever encountered. He was frequently absent throughout the course. Additionally, he would often respond to student inquiries very rudely. The lectures are useless and the tests are unjustifiably difficult. ",awful
277557,"Difficult class. It takes a lot of time and effort. One of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken. If you enjoy learning, you will love this class. If you want an easy 'A' don't take it.",awesome
277557,"In this class you have to ATTEND. STUDY. And STUDY some more. Yes it is very difficult, but very rewarding. Wonderful teacher, and is always willing to help.",awesome
277557,"Difficult class. Takes a lot of time and effort. (40+ hours a week) It has been one of the most rewarding classes ever taken. If you have any questions, all you need to do is ask. Also he is willing to meet with you if you contact him and set an appointment.",awesome
277557,Shively is an awesome guy but gives tests from hell. They are extremely difficult if you don't plan on making anatomy your life then I would recommend taking this class somewhere else.,average
277557,"Take from somewhere else. You will tear your hair out at the amount of work and time you will spend. I lived in the lab and studied like crazy, but did not pass. The tests are a huge downfall. You will not regret taking it from another university.",poor
277557,"If you do not have a job, and all you do is school, this class may be slightly easier for you. But it would be a lie to say he is a good teacher, or grades fairly. The study guides, and going to class contained maybe 10% of what is actually on the tests. The average test scores are around 35%.",poor
277557,Great teacher! Dr. Shively is legit! He says exactly what he means and follows through. He tells you exactly what you need to do in order to succeed. DO IT! Read the book. DO THE OBJECTIVES! Read the clinicals. Yeah it's hard. So make sure you work hard! Don't under estimate this class but it will be the best class if you put in the work required.,awesome
277557,"Shively is a good lecturer in that what he says is engaging and interesting to learn.  His tests though are horrendous. He does exactly what they say not to do when giving a test, and makes it so that everyone fails.  This is just the intro. class, yet it felt like the real thing minus the lab.  Do not take this class!",poor
277557,Best teacher for subject of anatomy. Always willing to help and explain subject matter. If you do the required work you will succeed .,awesome
277557,"Let me set the record straight: You will be fine in this class if you DO THE OBJECTIVES, STUDY THE REVIEW QUESTIONS, AND DO STUDY THE OUTLINE IN THE BOOK.  It's hard material,but Shively does a great job of helping you understand, but you need to study the book!  He'll help you if you work hard.  You'll love the class if you do!",good
277557,"Dr. Shively knows all about anatomy, but he's not a good teacher. His lectures consist of him making crude jokes, and making a point that he's smarter than the students. His tests consist of tricky questions, and he prides himself on low class averages. It's possible to get an A, you just have to dedicate your life to it and memorize the book.",awful
277557,Shively knows anatomy. He's the best there is as far as that goes. But he wears terrible scores as a badge of honor. This means that his tests are very difficult and designed to be tricky. He wants his students to dedicate their lives to his class and you'll need to do just that in order to get an A. Toughest class I've ever had.,average
277557,"I knew going in that this would be hard but this was insane. Dr. Shively is a really nice guy, and he went out of his way to help me out. That said, he has an ego the size of the school and it seems like he is proud of the fact that his is the hardest class on campus. He makes it TOO hard. Beware nursing students, he doesn't care much for you.",average
277557,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS,If you plan on having a life outside of anatomy! If you want to do well, plan on committing to 12 hours a week for both lab and lecture. Shively and his minions delight in making students feel dumb, and sucking up all their time. Don't feed the beast; take this course somewhere else!",average
277557,Doctor Shively is an amazing professor. The best I have had at UVU. Anatomy is a very hard class but Doc makes it clear what you need to know. Very clear and wants students to succeed and learn. His tests are difficult but ultimately really help you learn. Overall I really enjoyed this class although it was extremely hard.,awesome
277557,Don't believe the hype. The monster grade curve will atone for all your mistakes as long as you give your best. There's NO reason to fail this class or take it twice. DOn't beleive it. Find a good study crew and work hard.,average
277557,"As an introductory course, particularly for a student not in pursuit of a medical career, this class was very distressing.  I read the reviews here before taking this class and had a 'can do it' attitude but in retrospect I am asking, 'Why did I do that to myself?'  The class average was around 40% on tests!  Stressful...",average
277557,"Took this class and studied my butt off..of course to no avail. I am convinced that he finds pleasure in knowing people struggle and fail. I would not take another Anatomy course from UVU. I have come to hate Anatomy and after taking Homan's 2320, I changed my major.",average
277557,Shively is awesome! Hands-down the best class I have ever taken. Super helpful and kind. Knows everything about the subject. Willing to help outside of class or answer any question without making you feel dumb. Work hard-get a good study partner. Study exactly what he tells you from the book. An A is totally possible!!,awesome
277557,"Dr. Shively is AWESOME!! Hands-down the best class I have ever taken. Requires A LOT to get an A, but it's worth it. Study exactly what he says-don't just memorize-understand it well enough to explain it to someone else. Get a good study partner and work like you've never worked and you'll get SO much out of it. One complaint-doesn't use Canvas!",awesome
277557,"HORRIBLE teacher! I took this class via TV, so I was able to watch and rewatch the lectures. I took notes, attended every lecture, etc. The tests had very few things from class on them. I felt that attending class was pointless, because he went over things that weren't even kind of on the test. I felt like he was just trying to weed people out.",awful
277557,"People whine and moan about this class, but that's because you have to WORK HARD in this class, and people are not committed, or they are too lazy.  This class has been accused of many things, but understand this:  It is the most rewarding class you will ever take, and will prepare you for your medical career, hands down.",awesome
277557,"NEVER EVER TAKE ANATOMY WITH Shively!! He plays guitar, but it doesn't apply to anatomy! In my opinion, he makes fun of the students and probably just wants money and business. The tests and the requirements that he pushed students to take are ridiculous!",awful
277557,This was the hardest and the most rewarding class you will ever take.  You can practically applied the material taught in class into reality.  Be motivated and dedicated to this class and an A is possible.  If you work for it you can get it.  Must love to read to understand to survive this class.,poor
277557,HARDEST class I have ever LOVED. Be 110% committed and you will get an A. Dr. Shively is more than willing to help if you just ask!,good
277557,good teacher but the hardest class you will take,good
277557,"This class is not an easy class.  Shively expects more than just memorization.  He wants students to think critically about the material.  Once you realize he expects more than memorization, it makes the class more bearable and interesting.  He's a good instructor, though not the most helpful one on one.",good
277557,"HArdest class you will ever take... That being said, also the most rewarding. Shively is the man! Great teacher, definetely teaches you to think things through. Combo of him and homan was best learning experience I have had at uvu. Dedicate EVERYTHING to this class, and an A is possible",awesome
277557,Shively's Anatomy is about the hardest class you can take at UVU. He is very good at explaining things and knows almost everything about the subject. His tests are very difficult due to the wording of his questions and the vast amount of information you need to know. He is willing to help if asked. If you want to know the subject well take it here.,awesome
277557,"Shively is a nice guy but as a teacher he is misguided. He seems to have something against the health field (specifically nurses). Anyways, his tests are unclear with sometimes more than one answer possible but you have to pick Shively's choice. I got an A in the class (precurve) but regret taking the course with Shively - take it somewhere else",average
277557,"Shively is actually an awesome teacher, but demanding.  Study what he tells you to, but know it backwards and forwards.  Questions are tricky.  I earned an A w/o curve.  I know from friends grades that the curve is very generous.  This was my only class and I wasn't working, so it was my life.  It was hard, but I feel prepared for PA school.",good
277557,"If you've heard this is the hardest class you will take, you're right! But it will be the most rewarding class you will ever take. I'm in nursing school right now, and thanks to Shively i know my stuff forward and backward. I got an A with the curve but i dedicated my life to Anatomy! Good Luck, but be prepared to eat, sleep, breath Anatomy!",good
277557,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FROM SHIVELY. His quizzes/midterm/final are ridiculous. He seems to get some kind of entertainment by seeing students squirm and struggle. Says certain things will be or won't be tested on and it was always he opposite. You have a better chance of doing well if you take Homan, or take it at BYU and live to tell the story!",average
277557,"The trio of professors; Shively, Holman, and Bracken, shaped my love for human science. I am now a biomed engineering student which requires a rigorous attention to detail. Bracken helped teach how to think. Shively underlined the importance of being meticulous.  Holman instilled passion and taught me that med school is not the answer to everything",awesome
277557,Shively is a brilliant man... unfortunately he likes to wave that brilliance in students faces with the types of questions he asks on tests. Honestly the worst test giver i have ever heard of. if you take this class be ready to work your butt off and not score well. lab is great lecture is ridiculous.,average
277557,If you have the choice... GET HOMAN. shively is funny but his tests and quizzes are ridiculous,awful
277557,"Dr. Shively has taught for so long that his lectures seem to be memorized, so everything on the tests is mentioned in class. However, that does not mean they are easy at all. The average was in the 30s. You will learn a lot, and if you study you should do fine. In a way his class tests more on ability to answer trick questions than on knowledge.",awesome
277557,"Read the book extensively.  Obj's, Q's @ back of book, and ask things in class.  Well above avg on quizzes, C on final and got A.  Dr. Shively is demanding, but thorough and kind. DO xtra credit!",awesome
277557,"This class is the hardest class that I have taken in college. It is available to those who are just trying to get their generals done but this class is so in depth that unless you are going into the medical field, DON'T DO IT! If you are just getting your Associates, take another class!!",awful
277557,I took his online course and it was awful.  He offered us ZERO assistance and did not respond to one single email all semester.  I think it's unfair we can't review our exams to see what we missed and why.  He is harsh in his grading and likes to trick you on the quizzes and exams.  The high in our class was a 62% so he graded on a curve.,poor
277557,"Dr. Shively is amazing! The class is hard, but you get a lot out of it. I am hoping for an amazing curve so I can pass. Best day ever when he plays the guitar. He is laid back, easily approachable, just pay attention in class and don't chat. Get to know him, he is amazing! The class is really hard, but it will prepare you for an awesome career.",awesome
277557,"Exacting and challenging course.  Avg quiz score 72%, studied like a religion, Dr. Shively is warm and helpful.  This class taught me I can do anything.  HARD but thorough.",good
277557,"Take this class elsewhere if you must have A. Shively good, nice person, but tests unreasonable..asks &#63; not in text of lec book.  I studied 50 hrs a wk and would get 55 avg...was prior A student in classes like gen chem/science at UVU. If you must take at UVU, take from Homan.  He seems gruff, but not and tests actually from text of lecture book.",average
277557,"It's been a few yrs since I took this class, but b/c of this man I aced my med school Anatomy class. All the rumors that this is the hardest class you'll ever take are completely true. But that being said, med school anatomy was a cake walk after going through this class! So if you really planning on going into medicine, this is the class to take.",awesome
277557,"Dr. Shively is an excellent teacher- the fact that he and prof. Homan wrote their own books shows their commitment to their profession.  He is extremely knowledgeable and does a great job at pushing his students to truly think of solutions that we may face in our future.  Overall, read the book, do the practice questions- and learn how he asks Q's.",awesome
277557,One of my faviorite teachers at UVU. I enjoyed his class even though it was difficult. Very helpful if you ask and make sure you take time to meet with him.,good
277557,"VERY possible to do well in this class. Those who are complaining either don't know how to study or didn't put in enough time. The info is straightforward there's just a lot to learn. Doc will answer any question you have. Spent over an hour with me outside class answering questions. If your'e going into the medical field, take this class at UVU.",awesome
277557,"Many hate Dr. Shively but I really like him and the tests teach you to actually think. All tests from other teachers are a cinch after this. Work hard, don't fall behind or you'll never catch up. Expect to have no social life, live in the lab, read the text, always go to class, get into study groups! Read text before class and ask questions.",awesome
277557,"The anatomy class was a complete joke, he puts these bogus statistics all over the classroom, A;s B;s C;s etc completely false, we actual corresponded with each other during summer check with each others grades completely bogus, They have been trying to get rid of him for a while, Homan is worse.",awful
277557,"To start off with, many people have succeeded with A's and B's in this course, even first timers. For Lab, show up, quiz others, quiz yourself, point things out, utilize STAs. For Lecture, go through outline, read chapter, and quiz yourself. Shively will help you out, he will hold study sessions for questions. Write them down, think, and ask him.",average
277557,"Difficult teacher. Difficult subject. This class seemed better suited for Med school rather than UVU. The curves aren't bad. I got C's on the midterm and final and got an A- overall. You will study your butt off, and get used to late nights, but it's possible to pass.",average
277557,I was a straight A student. I studied every day. Once a week I stayed up ALL night studying. I got a B-. There was just too much material to cover and the lecture quizes are tricky even if &quot;Mr.&quot; shively disagrees. I'm embarrassed that I worked so hard and did so poorly. Thank you Mr. Shively,poor
277557,"How well you do in this class is a big indicator of what kind of person you are.  If you procrastinate, don't have basic study discipline, and if you just go through the motions--you will hate this professor, because he actually expects you to do something called work.  Welcome to college.",awesome
277557,"Dr. Shively is smart, and his class (and tests) are HARD but you probably already heard. He's a good teacher who knows his stuff, buckle down and learn how to study or wuss out and go somewhere else for this class. My favorite day was when he brought in his guitar.",good
277557,I worked very hard in this class. It required a lot of work for being an Intro class but felt like a higher level class. His tests were very tricky. I didn't like how he would ramble on and you didn't know what to study. Find a different professor!,awful
277557,"This class is the hardest thing I have ever done. You will study the text till you can no longer read. But I don't regret it. If you put in the time to study for each quiz, you will learn the material. The tests are tricky because of the wording, so watch yourself and learn his tricks. Don't take this class somewhere else if you want to be medical.",average
277557,This teacher requires A LOT of your attention. He is a great teacher and knows his stuff really well. I enjoyed the class but you will have to dedicate almost all of your time to this class!,average
277557,"At the end of this class you will have mastered critical thing as well as anatomy.  His tests and quizzes are the hardest I've taken, but you really know the stuff. IF you want to be good at your profession, take anatomy at UVU, if you just want to get a good grade then take it at slcc, and please don't be my doctor! In all, I do love anatomy now.",good
277557,"One of my favorite professors, his classes are tough, so no easy grade.  I think if you really try you will find he has a lot to offer as an instructor.",awesome
277557,"Shively is the funniest professor I've ever had. He's excellent at explaining all the concepts clearly. His quizzes and tests are insanely hard, but he grades on a curve so it's easy to get a good grade. My only complaint is that I had no idea what my grade was til after the course ended. But anyone who says stay away just didn't work hard enough.",awesome
277557,LITERALLY JUST STAY AWAY. TAKE IT FROM ANOTHER SCHOOL. I have always been a straight A student. I recieved a C+ in this class. I spent an average of 20+ hours in the lab a week and ten hours studying the lecture book. RUN AWAY NOW. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME..,poor
277557,I don't even know where to begin. The quizzes and tests are so ridiculous. Studying does no good whatsoever. Usually the class average on a quiz is around 35-50%. Shively is definately better than the other teachers. This class is literally a joke.,poor
277557,"Dr. Shivley knows his stuff and helps you learn it as well, but when it comes to the tests you have a better chance of doing well if you dont even study. His quizzes are by far the most tricky I have ever seen. And the most difficult. Anatomy is a great class and Shivley is a good teacher but be prepared to work your butt of and to have NO LIFE oth",good
277557,"This is a VERY hard class. Definitely not an easy a. Shively is a hilarious teacher and explains things well. Of all the anatomy teachers, he's the best!",good
277557,"I took the Zool 1090 class on line, and quite frankly it was completely unorganized and unprofessional.  The downloads for the course rarely worked, so I would highly recommend just renting the dvd's.  The dvd's were informative and Dr. Shively is definitely an intelligent man, however it was impossible to contact him.  The course was horrible.",average
277557,"this is an intense class, but you will learn your stuff. Treat this class like a full time job. Dr Shivley is brillent! he makes the best analogies, it really helped me in understanding certain processes. I highly highly recommend this professor!",awesome
277557,"The expectations for this class are unreal. The test questions are very hard, & test you on how well you read them rather than the material. His lectures don't really prepare you, but the material in the textbook does. That being said, Dr. Shively is an extremely nice & helpful man. I would definitely recommend him over other lecture instructors.",good
277557,Very intelligent guy and knows his stuff well! Be sure to keep up in the reading and his study guide that he gives out and ask a lot of questions. Also ALWAYS check the answers you got wrong on quizzes. Sometimes there were things on the quiz that I had never heard of so it is good to go back and clarify with him. He also grades on a curve.,awesome

He's not interested in teaching, just interested in complete memorization of his 1000 page text. Doesn't want right answers, want his answers. I would take this class at another university.",poor
277557,"Dr Shively is great.  His tests are ridiculously hard, but you learn a lot.  READ THE TEXT!  I went to class everyday, but a lot of what he teaches is in the text and a good chunk of what he doesn't!  Know the questions at the end of the chapter!  Draw the pictures he draws in lecture.  He's funny, and easy to listen to.",good
277557,"He's funny and a good teacher you just have to pay attention and take notes, I rarely read the book and didn't always do too great on the quizzes but if you do well in lab you'll be fine it does take up quite a bit of time but its interesting",good

277557,Shively is a really good teacher in that he knows his material. The class demands A LOT of time but its not hard to get a a good grade. just make sure to STUDY THE QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK! most times the test questions are exactly like them.,good
277557,Anatomy has always been my favorite subject till I took this class. I took it as an elective. Shively's tests and quizzes do not coordinate with material covered in class or what is in the book. He seems to like to watch us all struggle and fail. This class was a complete waste of time-if it isn't absolutely required for your major- don't take it.,poor
277557,"The assigned textbook was completely useless, study off the one he wrote and you'll be setting the curve. I love this teacher, he knows so much! I'm taking another one of this classes next.",good
277557,this class demands so much of your time! I did learn a ton about anatomy but the tests don't really have anything to do with that! I got above the class average every time but was still in the 40-60% range on all of them. If you attend class and study you will learn a ton but the tests and quizes are very overly difficult.,average
277557,"Doesn't prepare you for tests.  Hard test writer, often crude and offensive.",poor
277557,"This class becomes your LIFE!! Plan on studying 24/7. I don't agree with his tests at all. I think he should test you more on what you study, not how well you can get into his mind. He is very tricky with his tests. Something is wrong when you fail a test and your happy cause you know its at least average. Something is wrong with that!",average
277557,"If the same passion of the Prof was shared with his students, there would be better grades thus better ratings. A little overkill for an intro. I'm just bitter because I dont have 15-20hrs a week to study because of famil/work/school. I learned more practical stuff about Anatomy and Physiology in my Emt Basic and Intermediate classes.",average
277557,"Dr. Shivley is awesome. He is difficult but it will prepare you for any health related course you plan on taking. STUDY, READ, GO TO OPEN LAB and You'll do fine. Take anatomy from him. All the people who give poor ratings just didn't put in the time.",awesome
277557,He thrives off of failing students and the on the midterm the high was a 62%!  All the quizzes and tests contain material not gone over in class or in the text.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS FROM HIM!,poor
277557,"This class is very frustrating.  His tests are so hard that getting an &quot;F&quot; on a test is good.  That's a problem in my mind.  If you can't or aren't willing to put ALL your time into this class, then don't take it from him!  I have no problem in working hard and studying hard to succeed, but his class is beyond rediculous.  Don't take it from him.",good
277557,"Difficult, yes, but he tells you where test questions will come from--the questions in his book.  Know the answers to those questions and you will be fine.  Best professor I've had (I went to UVU and graduated at UofU).  I am more proud of doing well in this class than any other--it was the hardest class I had.",awesome
277557,I have done a huge disservice to myself by not giving this class the time it requires to do well.  I have children and only arranged daycare for the time I was in lab and lecture.  I should have put them in all day and treated this summer class like a full time job.  Had I done this I would be a lot less stressed out.  Don't make my mistake!,good
277557,"I wanted an A and got one by having a study group, going to as many open labs as I could, reading the books, by not getting discouraged and staying motivated. Shively is always walking around school just waiting for students to bump into him and ask him a question. Hard class but worth it because you get a thorough tour of the human body!",awesome
277557,"Plus- Shively is extremely knowledgable. He understands what he is talking about.He offers to help you outside of class. He can be quite hilarious at times.Minus- the test are indredibly hard and on top of that, Shively is always making mistakes so they have to be rekeyed.Students would learn more if tests were not so hard. Bonus- grades on a curve",awesome
277557,"This class is difficult, but I learned soooooo much. Shively's quizzes are really hard, but as long as you do as poorly as everyone else, you'll pass. I loved his lectures, even though I was scared to death the first week or so. Don't put things off in this class or you will be sorry. Shively is extremely smart and willing to help you out.",good
277557,"This class takes up your life!! Be prepared to wear around your under eye circles.. his quizzes are as obscure as his mind...he's very intelligent, but you have to think like he does during test time. he's hilarious and I made really good friends for the lab on this class.  I suggest to NEVER PROCRASTINATE in this class.",good
277557,"Hmm, will I have an &quot;A&quot; or a &quot;D&quot;&#63; A very common question among his students.          This class is extremely time consuming, and most times very frustrating. Don't let your score of 25% fool you, it might actually be the class high on a test. Very hard teacher, but rather entertaining. Take his classes with other EASY classes! or else!!",good
277557,Don't let his relaxed in class attitude fool you! Yes his lectures are fun and he is entertaining- but his tests will rock your world if you haven't read EVERYTHING in the test! Curve is the only way people pass so stay on top of it!,good
277557,"If I were you, I would take a critical thinking class before taking this class.  Half of the time I wasn't sure what he was asking for.  When the class average is 40%(ish) or lower, then it is the there is something the teacher is not doing right. This class is insane.  Plan on studying for at least 20 hours a week for this class alone. Good luck!",average
277557,I cannot believe how much people complain and moan about this class!!.  Yes it is very hard and challenging but you are given everything you need to succeed.  Absolutely fantastic teacher!!!!,awesome
277557,No one should ever complain about his anatomy class. Sure its hard but he gives you the tools to succeed its just a matter if you use them. If you plan on being in the medical field this class is a great eye opener to see what it is like. I highly reccommend his class. He is an amazing teacher and you will learn a ton.,average
277557,"It's funny reading all the ratings. He's very hard, there's no way around that. But it all depends on your work ethic and attitude. If you are committed to working hard and have a good attitude about him and anatomy, you'll do fine. It's graded on a curve which helps a lot.",average
277557,"Amazing teacher! He is very smart and his tests are challenging. There is a curve at the end, but you still need to work hard. It can be an imtimidating class when you first start because its a lot of information to cover in a lower division class, but if your going into the medical field or grad school its worth it. Good Luck!",good
277557,"It makes me laugh to see everybody complaining about Dr. Shively. He is one of the best instructors I have ever had, and is very fair. He even curved my whole class up 25 points at the end of the semester.  If you can't get a good grade with a 25% boost, you shouldn't be a science major.",good
277557,I would have done better if Lab and Lecture for this class worked together and taught the same thing at the same time.,average
277557,"If you are looking to go into anything w/ the medical field you need to take Shivley's class! It is hard, but if you study hard you will do fine. He's a great teacher and very funny.",awesome
277557,"He is a very good teacher, his quizzes are extreamly hard though. This is not a class that you can just slide by in. You have to put in tons of time and effort.  He is very helpful, and cares about his students so much! He wants us to do well, and understands that his class is very hard. He wants us to really know our stuff. Great but hard teacher",good
277557,This course is super hard for an intro class. The majority of the class was failing all quizzes and tests. He would teach us the simple things and then test us on the more complex things that weren't ever explained in class. Good luck!,poor
277557,"Dr. Shively is the author of 3 of the books you have to purchase.  so you go to class he gets paid to teach you then he chooses which text you have to buy, and of course he wants to put more money in his pocket!!!",awful
277557,Do not take this class unless you plan to become a doctor!  He pushes you way harder than it is worth for a lower level class.  In fact I think the professors think it is an upper level class.  You can take anatomy online from another college and trust me it is much easier! Also you have to put in way to much time for a 4 credit class!!!,awful
277557,One of the top two professors of my college experience.  Dr. Shively cares about helping students learn.  He is one of the few teachers at UVU that pushes his students because he wants them to realize their potential.  He is extremely fair with his grading and anyone who says otherwise didn't put the time or effort into the class.,awesome
277557,For all of those who say this class is unfair and too hard...you probably didn't put in the necessary amount time.  Doc Shively is an extremely good teacher and he is very clear about you need to know for his tests.  I recommend taking this class with a &quot;lighter load&quot; or during the summer because you do need to put in the time to be successful!!,awesome
277557,"it is a good class, but just be prepared to work at it like crazy!!!! I really think Shively is a good teacher, but he is a hard one, so don't go into it expecting a mildly challenging class! study his book CAREFULLY. his tests are hard, but after a while you can start to see how he writes them and study for them accordingly and ASK QUESTIONS",good
277557,"I have never written a bad review about a professor before, but Shively is honestly one of the worst professors I have ever had.  He is extremely arrogant, extremely disorganized, doesn't follow his own schedule, it takes forever for you to get your tests back, in all honesty, avoid him if you can, you don't even learn anything with him.",awful
277557,"Easy class.  Take good notes, study throughout the semester to avoid the big push at the end.  I studied maybe 1 hour a week, and 5 hours the week before the final and got an A even before the 20 point curve.",awesome
277557,"Dr. Shively makes this class simple. He is very specific about what will and won't be on the tests, and explains things very well.",awesome
277557,"Shively is AWESOME! Absolutely loved the class! I am not an extremely smart person, but put forth the effort, and got an A in the class. I don't get how people say he is unfair. Its those people who are trying to get out of studying and get an easy A. Study, devote your life to it and you'll do fine. I HIGHLY recommend Shively! He was the BEST!!!:)",awesome
277557,He is just way too smart for his own good.I stuied my butt off and I still did terrible. You learn a lot but still do crappy on the tests. This class was way too hard for being an intro class.,awesome
277557,"Shively was one of the worst teachers I've ever had.  He's extremely arrogant, and believes he is god's gift to anatomy.  He is not there to teach, he's there to prove to you how smart he is.  Luckily, I ended up with an A because I stayed ahead of the curves, but that was no thanks to him.",awful
277557,"Shively is a great instructor and really knows his stuff. His quizzes are pretty difficult but not impossible to get a good score on. Use good, I'm mean very good test taking skills but studying hard is the key and don't get discouraged. Also, take advantage of every opportunity that he gives for extra credit. It will pay off",awesome
277557,"He's super hard, but knows everything! really awesome guy!",awesome
277557,"Class was very interesting and Shively keeps you entertained.  The class requires a LOT of effort though, but if you work hard it will pay off, there is a big curve at the end so the goal is to just stay above the average (which tends to be around 40-60%). Would not recommend taking this class with other classes that would require a lot of time...",average
277557,"Love this professor- lectures are humorous, informative and interesting with anecdotes designed to clarify and stick.  Tests are the devil, the wording is tricky, requires more knowledge than was given or contained in the book.  But, big curve at the end (I averaged high 50's, low 60's, & got an A.)  Still, love Shively- great guy.",good
277557,"Make sure to take all easy classes if you are going to take this class. This was the hardest introduction class I have taken. Lectures are awesome, he knows his anatomy and he is always keeping the mood light in the classroom. Tests and quiz's are impossible to do good on. Take the class and study hard. Major curve at the end.",good
277557,"Though his knowledge and expertise are unquestionable, Shively is a worthless teacher. Common sense is not his strong point and i would never recommend his class to anyone.",awful
277557,hardest class I have ever taken! You will hate this class! Don't take it!,awful
277557,"This class is very interesting and you learn a lot, but the tests are packed with material so you have to study tons and theyre still impossibly hard.",good
277557,Way good teacher. His book looks cheap but is the most useful study guide I have ever used. Its a tough class but I learned tons from Doc Shively.,awesome
277557,Words tests so they are next to impossible to understand. And students do not receive results of tests a quizzes till sometimes a month after it was taken. Very hard to study for the next test/quiz when you don't know how you did on the first one.,poor
277557,Great teacher.,awesome
277557,Great Teacher,awesome
277557,"Very hard class, no matter how much effort you put in you still get a bad grade.",awful
277557,"Class was hard. He knows his stuff. Made things clear to understand, but there are a LOT of  &quot;things&quot; to learn.  Study hard - you'll be OK.",good
277557,"This class is ridiculous. Shively is a trickster, just cause you know the everything about the question, doesn't mean you'll get it right. If you want to memorize a 500 page text book then take this class. Also, plan on going to open lab EVERY night from 10pm-12. But yes, huge curve at the end.",average
277557,"Don't be fooled by the songs and jokes, this dude doesn't mess around when it comes time to take a test.  I studied my arse off and never got better than a 70% on a test. Took it again from Dr. Bayer and did MUCH better.",average
277557,"He is a Nice guy, but who cares&#63; he wants to fail you, I spent every night at lab, and it was not good enough, he wants to trick you, IMPOSSIBLE tests! he knows his stuff, but does not want you to learn it or would not make it so hard!. Take it at BYU, take it somewhere else. He is obssessed with the subject,even wrote songs about it!way too hard!",poor
277557,"HARD! tons of time spent studying for this class. he makes it entertaining and makes the material comprehensiable, but his test are CRAZY! just stick it out until the end NO MATTER what. at the end you will see a HUGE curve and as long as you put the time into it, your grade might not reflect it at the moment but at the end...its victory",average
277557,"Let's be honest.  His tests are rediculously hard.  You would think after giving a 30 point curve on the 2nd test he would get a clue, but he didn't.  he makes it unbelievebly difficult and demanding on your time.  He is a great teacher and makes lecture really fun.  If your going to take him be prepared to eat, sleep, breathe anatomy.",average
277557,"do what he says, study alot, live at the lab and you will do well -",awesome
277557,Very good teacher.  Knows everything about anatomy! Test suck BUT keep going there is a BIG CURVE! If you do anything and everything he asks you'll pass the class.,good
277557,"No matter who you take it from, anatomy is not an easy class.  Shively is very entertaining and makes lectures fun to go to.  He is very interested in his students and tries to know everyone by name.  If you do you part and study your butt off you'll love this class!",good
277557,"THis guy is an effective teacher, however, his course is quite demanding on time and effort to pass with a semi-decent grade. I work full time and do not have 30 hours  of study time to put in to this freakin class.",good
277557,"I heard this was the hardest class ever.  I got an A, but there was a lot of memorizing, but what the hell do you expect when you learn anatomy.  Doc Shively was great!  WAY FREAKIN SMART, and knows his stuff!!  When you figure out how he tests the tests are easy if you study a little!  Great teacher though this class was great!",awesome
277557,"his class is hard but if you have to take anatomy, take if from the best. he writes the test for the other anatomy teachers so you might as well get the info from the source. be prepared to hate yourself and do NOT take other hard classes with this schedule. theres only so much time to eat, sleep and study uvsc anatomy.",good
277557,"He is the most amazing teacher you can ask for.  He has a ton of students every semester, but he tries to help you individually with any questions.  You have to spend a lot of time studying, but its an amazing subject and totally worth it.  Anyone who says different is a total whiner.",awesome
277557,"Dr Shively is a good teacher, and I did learn a lot.  My one complaint is that he seems to really enjoy trying to trick you on his tests. As mentioned in other ratings, be prepared to work your tail off.",good
277557,"Shively is a hard teacher, I won't lie. And his tests are WAY hard too, but overall he is a way nice guy. I recommend him, but just remember that the class is hard regardless of the teacher :)",good
277557,"Anybody who talks bad about this class are the ones who keep UVSC's stereotype of &quot;glorified high school&quot; alive. This is a REAL college class. So quit spending dad's dollar and put your face in a book. You get what you earn. Dr. Shively is the best teacher I've had yet. Very helpful with any question, any time!",awesome
277557,"I consider myself to be a great student, but this class was too much. I had to put in 35-40 hours a week of study and class time for a 4 credit hour class. I had to use his book that he wrote that was not edited and had no color. One day in class he said &quot;I can not beleive how stupid this class is&quot;. Horrible teacher that is only there for himself.",awful
277557,"Dr. Shively is awesome. He makes class so interesting. This class is really hard, but I learned so much. It's not impossible to get a good grade as long as you put lots of time into studying. I'm not a straight-A student, and I came out of this class with an A. Just make sure you're ready to work your butt off.",awesome
277557,This has honestly been my favorite class. Dr. Shively is a great professor! Just be prepared to study and work hard.,average
277557,I liked this class but was not easy.  Shively is by far the best teacher on the subject.,good
277557,REALLY FREAKIN HARD,awful
277557,The only reason Dr. Shively's students don't get high scores is because the tests and quizzes only include 25 and 50 questions each. He is very interested in helping his students and a lot of extra points have been added to tests lately.,awesome
277557,"its a crazy workload (tons of busy work) with limited lab hours, some of which are a 10pm to midnight window. Many of the questions, especially on lab tests, arent clear cut in refference to the desired answer and more often than not pleading your case is futile. No one cares where you took the class so unless you are a glutant for punishment take ",poor
277557,smiles when someone fails his class.,awful

277557,Excellent teacher!,awesome
277557,"This is the best class at UVSC. Don't listen to anyone that tells you it's hard -- as long as you can memorize, you'll be fine. There's a ton of material, but nothing is difficult to understand. Shively & Homan are AWESOME. You DO have to live at school to get an A though, so be ready for 12hr study-sessions!",awesome
277557,"Wow, really really hard class- but all the anatomy teachers are the same, they have to be so take it from the man, Shively!  He knows his stuff.  Be prepared for no social life- I was at school from 9am-midnight almost everyday but it paid off cause i got an A, it's not impossible!  Good luck!",good
277557,This was the hardest class I have ever taken.  I pride myself on being intelligent and have always gotten really good grades.  On that note.....I did HORRIBLY in Dr. Shivley's class.  He is a nice person but the class is rediculous for an intro class.,average
277557,"Doc is probably the best teacher at UVSC. He isn't easy and bad study habits die a hard and painful death with him. I retook the class after an E that woke me up from apathy, got an A. But I put it all on the line. The book, blue study guide and engage him all the time worked for me and my group. Can not recommend him enough.",awesome
277557,Dr. Shively is the best teacher I have ever come across.  The class actually tests your capabilities.  If you want a professor that is passionate and wants you to succeed than I would definitely take it from him.  If you put in a good attitude expecting it to take alot of work than you will come out satisfied.,awesome
277557,No Comments,awful
277557,"Shively is a wonderful teacher! No the class is not easy..  This class will make you think, by the time the semester is over you will really  know your stuff. He is willing to answer your questions   even on his time. If you do the reading, ask questions & study hard. You will do great!  If you don't do these things the class will kick your  rear!!",awesome
277557,"An awesome teacher! Very helpful, tells you exactly what you need to know & how to study it. the class is way detailed though, so take it seriously and plan on studying your butt off if you want to pass.",awesome

277557,"Dr. Shively is one of the best professors at UVSC.  He is very interested in his students and tries his best for you to understand the material.  The tests are a b****, but if you study and I mean STUDY you'll do well.",awesome

277557,No Comments,awful
277557,"Dr. Shively wants his students to learn and is very kind and respectful to your questions.  On the other hand the you have to make anatomy your life for a semester if you want to pass.  His tests trick you and I don't think that is fair. Overall, he is a VERY smart and nice guy.",awesome
277557,"Dr. Shively is a great teacher.  He makes things interesting and has a great sense of humor.  The only problem are his tests, which are very frustrating because he tries to trick you.  I guess that is good for weeding out the bad pre-med students, but too drastic for intro to anatomy",awesome
277557,He is very nice and willing to take time to help any of students.  Super smart.,awesome
277557,"Want a hard but fun anatomy class&#63;  Take it from the MAN.  Shively is one of the few respected teachers at UVSC!  Take that Dr. Parker!  Shively spends alot of time with the students and has built a very nice anatomy course!  Hard, but worth it if u go into grad school!",awesome
277557,This is the best teacher ever!!! This is a very hard class because everyone wants their doctor/nurse who's working on them to know their stuff.  Shively is a walking dictionary.  Who better to learn from than the man who knows it all!  He really makes it fun!,awesome
277557,No Comments,awesome
277557,"I loved this class,he taught so well and made it fun. It is one of the hardest classes at UVSC. But if you put in time you will learn A LOT and get the grade you want.",awesome

277557,"Dr. Shively is the only anatomist on on this side of the country.  He wrote the book so the tests are really hard.  If you're going into medicne, take anatomy from him.  He helped me decide on a career in the medicne field.",awesome

103621,Horrible teacher. Smart guy. Very confusing when he lectures. He jumps around and is very scatter brained. I went in for help on multiple occasions and he told me to not worry about it 'it won't be on the test'. But then those concepts were on the test and I did poorly. I ended this class with a C- which is the lowest grade I've ever received.,awful
103621,"My advice to any student looking to take Biology would be, find any other teacher in the school to take this class from. Whaley is a very smart man. However, he is not a good teacher. You will have to read & teach yourself. His tests are difficult and have strange wording. He is also very disrespectful when he tries to answer a students question.",awful
103621,"Go to class, take the pre-lecture quizzes, and do the extra credit he offers!  He even posts exam practices that are pretty much the same as his exams, so there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to be prepared for them.  This class is graded heavily on exams, so if you study and make sure you understand the concepts then you'll be fine.",good
103621,If you're confused during a lecture don't ask him just google it or something. Because he'll just confuse you even more. There's quite a heavy work and little room for messing up (just like most classes). Exams are borderline brutal and he offers very little extra credit to fix that. You're supposed to read all 24 assigned chapters. 30 Pages each.,poor
103621,"My major is biology because I love it! But after the first day of class I realized what I was in for... lots of late nights of stuDYING and tear covered papers. I've failed almost every test and I've studied like crazy. He likes to play the 'guess what I'm thinking' game, but he thinks really oddly. He requires so much outside of class.",awful
103621,Hardly learned anything from the teacher. The most you will learn is from the kid sitting next to you and the internet. When asked questions he either gets frustrated or repeats himself exactly how he worded it the first time. Tests are really hard and there is a lot of homework. I'm a good student and I felt I was drowning.,awful
103621,I'd rather be replace my visine with onion juice than sit through another lecture with Mr. Whaley. If being pubicly insulted is your thing Simply ask a question during class! You will be quizzed everyday. You will read everyday. You will be required to do work with his TA outside of class which is the only time you'll learn something.,awful
103621,"I am not very good at Biology, but this teacher made it that much more difficult for me to understand. He knows all about biology but he can't teach it worth a darn. He is constantly yelling at students for asking questions. He requires you to meet with his T.A's every week and they hate him too. They were my only saving grace to pass this class.",awful
103621,"Not a good teacher. The course is fine if you're driven to learn on your own, but he probably won't be much help.",awful

103621,Does not like to help students and is rude when questions are asked in class. He never understood where students were coming from and confused the class every time he tried to clarify something. He really just wanted to teach Ornithology to the class when we were in 1610.,poor
103621,"Expects you to teach yourself the material. Gets irritated when you don't understand. He is a horrible teacher, doesn't understand questions. Gets things mixed up while teaching. Very confusing. He's a nice guy but a bad teacher.",awful
103621,"Wayne is a nice guy, but a horrible teacher. When you ask questions in class he hardly ever understands and will go off and answer a totally different question that has nothing to do with what you asked.  He requires you to buy the expensive clicker, text book, and online access. His tests and quizzes are also worded strangely and extremely hard.",poor
103621,"I feel like his lectures are worthless. Don't be fooled, this isn't an easy A. You never really know what's going to be on the test unless you have a good TA to help with the recitation session. You really don't know what you need to study but it's based on total points so do all the homework and get 100% on that. ",awful
103621,"Its possible to get an A, you will for sure learn the material, but most of that will be accredited to the homework you do. If you ask a question in class, he won't understand it, he'll go on a big rant about something unrelated to the question, and a person who sits by you will end up answering your question. ",poor
103621,Couldn't stand the class. He constantly lectures about pointless issues that have nothing to do with the class and treats not being as intelligent as him as a crime. You must buy the overpriced book and expensive clicker if you want to pass. Turned biology into my most dreaded class even though I love bio. Doesn't answer questions either   ,awful
103621,"Whaley is a nice and funny guy but he isn't a very good teacher and his lectures are pointless .. you have to go though because clicker questions are worth a lot on your grade. The only way to pass is to study hard for the tests and read each chapter thoroughly because the tests are hard,  but they are all curved (including the final) which helped.",average
103621,"Great guy, but poor teaching skills. I would not recommend taking a class from him unless you already have a good understanding of biology and enjoy teaching yourself the material. He gives tons of pre-lecture quizzes and the tests were rough. I didn't learn much from his class.",poor

103621,Terrible. Doesn't provide any help outside of class. Requires you to already know the information and do the homework before he teaches it to you. Completely useless as a professor.,poor
103621,"This class if fairly simple.  If you have any background in chemistry or previous biology classes it will be a breeze.  Tests come directly from lecture slideshows and the practice exams he offers on Canvas. Exams are very straight forward.  Mandatory recitations are worthless, but lectures are bearable.  ",average
103621,"I'm reviewing Bio, though I also took ornithology from him, since I think it's more applicable. He will expect you to put in effort and respect his field. The class will not be easy, but totally possible and you will learn more than you ever have from a class! He loves birds and butterflies so take upper division from him if you get a chance!",awesome
103621,"This class can be challenging at times, but it's not because of the professor. Some chapters are just difficult. He provides you with more than enough resources to succeed. Practice exams helped a ton. He drops your lowest test score, and the final is really easy. There's also a few extra credit opportunities. If you do your part you'll do well.",average
103621,"Expected us to only prepare one presentation and to come every week so we can critique the other presenters.  Fairly easy.  However, the bio department tried to make us write papers as well, but it was turned down.  May be enforced in the future.  He does interrupt the presenters fairly often to give his 2¢ even though it's not his presentation.",average
103621,"The only reason I got an A in this class is because I took intro bio and a principles of chem courses prior to enrolling. If you don't already have a strong foundation of both bio and chem you will struggle in this class. He talks at about 1000 wpm on a bad day, and doesn't listen very well. But he is committed to making sure you learn.",average

You have to read the book before class to understand the lecture. Clicker questions during class count as a test score. He wants students to understand and will help outside of class.",good
103621,Prof. Whaley want's people to do good on tests and gives lots of time in class for questions. The key to his class is reading the text BEFORE class. All of the pre-quiz stuff comes out of the book and will really get you started on the topic. Do your vocab and make sure you know what his slides are referring to.,good
103621,"This guy is literally the worst professor I have had. He babbles incoherently about the subjects at hand and his powerpoints aren't helpful. You have to read the chapters word for word or you won't pass, and on top of the normal required lab he has required labs of his own that are counted in your grade. He is unbearably bad at teaching.",awful
103621,"I have no interest in biology but professor Whaley is a super nice guy. He can be condescending at first, but if you get passed that he really cares about his students and their quality of learning. Not many professors dedicate as much time to their students as he does. It wasn't an easy class, you have to read the textbook but at least you learn.",awesome
103621,"Whaley is a nice guy but he is not good at teaching BIOL 1610. His lectures are confusing and boring. Youtube videos will be your best bet to understand what he is talking about. His tests are multiple choice & aren't super hard. He is using the clicker so people show up to class because honestly, you could pass this class without ever showing up.",average
103621,DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I had to drop this class becuase it was way too hard and Whaley doesn't teach well at all. He has powerpoints that have the information for the tests on them but then they end up not having the information needed. He expects you to not memorize the information but to learn it and apply it on the test. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS!,awful
103621,"Do not take Biology 1610 from Whaley. He is so confusing and doesn't teach anything that is on his tests. Not only that, but he expects you to know things that aren't even in the book. He goes off on random tangents about birds all the time. He doesn't ever understand any ones questions so you don't get a clear understanding.",poor
103621,"This guy is a terrible professor. He is constantly contradicting what he says. When students have questions, he can't answer them clearly and just says the same exact thing he said that made them confused in the first place. Don't get me wrong, he's undoubtedly a great person, he is just terrible at teaching.",awful
103621,The only reason he is a teacher is because it's a job in biology.  Puts his own bio interests in the lectures that have nothing to do with the test. Very long and difficult quizzes are due before class every period. Lectures are useless and confusing. He just fills in for the bio department. Expects you to learn all from your reading. Find another,awful
103621,"Worst Biology Teacher at the University.  Such a hard class, filled with useless information. Others in lab with different teachers knew so much more than Whaley's students.  His powepoints were so long and useless.  Puts his own interests into the lesson rather than what we need to know for the test.  He doesnt even like to bio.  He just fills in",awful
103621,"Dr. Whaley is the worst. I am an A student and I had to drop the class.  Daily powerpoints are 80+ slide long.  Test and homeworks are so hard.  He does not care to know who you are and hates anawsering questions.  Find another teacher at all costs.  He threw in so much useless information. He even told us he does not like this biology, but zoology",awful
103621,He's one of those teachers who thinks all you do is attend their class and study biology.  Half of the tests he gives are open on saturday and if you take them on monday you pay a fee. If you dont understand the concepts prior to class you may leave confused as he mixes up words and concepts.  He's a less than average professor.,poor
103621,"Very scatter brained, and hates awnsering questins i class. He loves laughing at himself teaching because he doesnt comprehend that his students dont understand what he teaches. DO the MASTERING BIOLOGY and you may pass.",poor
103621,"I went to class everyday, took notes, did my homework and reading. I went to every review session possible and I did horrible. I have never failed a class before and I have good grades. He was not helpful. He talks fast and expects you to learn a lot from your own reading. He doesn't give you time to process the info and some of it is irrelevant.",awful
103621,"Dr Whaley is a good guy that wants to help how he can. His lectures can seem unclear at times but are atleast somewhat helpful on average bc he gives similar or even exact questions on quizzes/tests. I can see why some ppl think he's condescending but his intentions are good. Just not as sensitive as some, he's an east-coaster. Easy A if you study",good
103621,Showing up to class will prove uneventful given that it is entirely possible to get an A in the class from simply showing up on the first day and once again on the last day for the final exam. It is likely that many students will gain nothing from showing up to class on a daily basis.,poor
103621,"A lot of students don't like him because he is a &quot;hard&quot; teacher.  It's the amount of material that he has to cover that is a the problem for most students, they just use him as a scapegoat. If the Student wants to succeed, Whaley helps the student do so, but it is ultimately up to the student to decide how well they want to perform in the class.",average
103621,"he is a great guy but does not know how to teach these classes at a lower level. upper level classes are great. he does not like to answer questions, tests are way hard. take another teacher if possible, if not you will live in your book if you want to pass.",poor
103621,"Professor Whaley is a Zoologist whose passionate about birds, and butterflies. So the only way he's managed teaching his 1610 micro biology class, is because he's memorized his 5 year old PowerPoint lessons. He doesn't like taking questions. He doesn't have a study guide. He writes his tests like riddles. Must self teach from book to pass class.",average
103621,Love this Man. He really enjoys teaching upper division courses. I took him for 1610 and worked my butt off for a B. I barley put in 1 hr a week in ZOO and am getting an A. Definitely take Animal Behavior from him. Fun class and laid back grading.,good
103621,"You knew you were signing up for a class taught by an ornithologist, how interesting did you think it would be&#63; Extremely painful to sit through class as he reads verbatim off the slides. Teach yourself, be discipline in reading and mastering biology you'll be fine. If you thought this class was hard take Ochem, your defintion of hard will change.",awful
103621,Real smart man. But terrible at sharing what he knows. Very confusing. If you take his class plan on learning the stuff on your own because his lectures are not helpful at all. I had the hardest times staying awake in class :( A zoologist teaching biology didn't seem to mix well,poor
103621,"Definitely a bird man. Little scattered sometimes on his lectures. Read the book, attend class and go through his power points and you will do fine",poor
103621,"Professor was interesting.  However, he was knowledgeable in the field (hence PhD, though it is in Zoology).  The book was used a lot, but his tests are straight out. I would recommend attending class since he gives out a lot of tips for tests. overall: Great, just more fast-paced.",good
103621,"Mr. Whaley is decent.  His tests and quizzes are quite easy even without reading regularly as long as you show up to class.  However, if you're actually trying to learn the subject it can be very difficult.  He's is very poor with answering questions and he often goes on long tangents.  Easy for science credit, poor for learning.",poor
103621,His lectures are ridiculously hard to understand and he never actually teaches the material covered on the 6 midterm tests that are given during the semester.  You are forced to learn solely from the textbook. I would avoid his class like the plague but I hear the other BIOL 1610 teachers aren't any better...,poor
103621,"Professor Whaley is a sweet, sweet man.  I regret to inform you that he isn't the best teacher.  He speaks very quickly and doesn't answer questions very clearly.  I wish he was my grandpa rather than my BIO 1010 teacher.",average
103621,"The professors teaching capabilities were low and came off as extremely condescending; especially when questions were asked. He also tested way harder than the level that he taught and even quizzed at. One on one, his personality is great and you can tell he means well.",average
103621,"Pretty good teacher. He can be a little confusing at times, but he gives you his power points, which if you know, you know the test. He requires you to have a very conceptual understanding of the material. You won't do well if you are not willing to read and STUDY his power points. He gets you ready for the DAT and MCAT if you are pre health bound!",average
103621,"Whaley is a pretty good teacher. you really have to understand the concepts to do well, you can't just regurgitate information. the tests were fairly challenging, and you do have to actually study the book and the powerpoints. he offers extra credit, which is helpful. i would definitely take another class from him.",good
103621,"This professor was awesome! I had him a few years ago and he was tough, but I learned so much. He taught Biology 1 and 2 when I was preparing for the MCAT and I scored a 14 in Biological sciences. AWESOME. He is passionate about biology and about butterflies, and that passion shows when he teaches. It can be contagious if you will let it!",awesome
103621,He is the man! He is so funny and is really helpful. You have to read the book and go to class. At the first of the semester he is kind of strait and blunt with people but as the semester goes on and you keep coming to class he likes you and is even better.,awesome
103621,"Wayne is a great professor.  It has been a while since I have taken any science courses and was a little nervous for this class. If you go to class, take notes, read the chapter at least once and STUDY the STUDY GUIDES you should get an A. I would study about 1-2 hours a day.  Good Luck!",good
103621,"How to do well in his class: read the slides, study the practice tests, do the end of chapter quiz's.  Honestly this was NOT that difficult of a class.  Just don't depend on whaley, go to the study center or make friends in the class",average
103621,If you like reading the book and getting no help from the professor then Whaley is the teacher for you.  He has been rated for the past 7 years and still has horrible ratings.,awful
103621,This most worthless class ever. You can tell that Dr. Whaley hates teaching it. He stutters around questions and is generally unhelpful. His class is pretty easy as long as you read the book and go over his practice tests. He gives one in-class quiz at the beginning of the semester but after that don't even bother going to class.,awful
103621,"I really don't understand all the negative comments about Doctor Whaley. I find him amiable, humorous, and genuinely knows his material. Sometime he can go off on tangents and forget to answer a question, but overall, I think he is a great professor.",good
103621,"Before I took a class from Professor Whaley, I loved Biology. This man's style of teaching, or the lack thereof, is completely ridiculous. His lame excuses and patronizing &quot;disscusions&quot; get old very fast. Don't take Bio from Whaley, whatever you do. He is understanding sometimes, but most times, he'll just tell you to &quot;change your major.&quot;",awful
103621,"Do not take this class from Whaley! He was no help in letting the class know what would be on the tests, I got better grades when I didn't show up for class on the tests then when I went all the time.  The final was awful and he made no effort to tell us anything that would be on it or tell us what we should study.",awful
103621,"Whaley rocks! He knows his stuff, he's enthusiastic about the topic, and he's always available to help his students. Clearly if you're unwilling to put actual effort into learning you need to choose a different major.",awesome
103621,"Great as a person outside of class, BUT A HORRIBLE TEACHER!! When asked a question, he wouldn't answer, or would expect you to know. Wasn't able to answer his own test questions, test questions were incorrect and from a different book. He is not the teacher for learning Bio.",poor
103621,"If you can't handle East Coast personalities don't take him. Otherwise, he's great, just study!",good
103621,"Whaley is a cool guy, and makes his class as easy as possible.  He tells you specifically what will be on his tests, so if you aren't getting an A, it is your own fault.",awesome
103621,"Whaley is a character.  The first three sections I went every day and studied his power points, I got a 67, 72, and a 71. I started going once a week, and studying the book only.  I started getting 90's on his exams.  He was rude to me whenever I went to his office to talk to him.  Stay with the book, you'll be fine.",poor
103621,"Prof. Whaley is very scatterbrained sometimes.  I hardly attended class and got a good grade.  He tests straight from the book (and uses questions from his practice exams).  Whenever I have tried to talk to him he blew me off, demanding to know why I was in his office, and that if I needed something to hurry because he has a &quot;lot to do.&quot;",average
103621,Hard class you have to study like crazy!! Prof. wasn't too bad though.,poor
103621,"Dr. Whaley gets a bad rap.  His class is hard, but this is college.  1610 is in the top three hardest biology classes on campus.  Do homework and study!  I studied over 30 hours for the final, but I got an A dangit!.  If you want a free A change your major",good

103621,I think he gets a bad rap. I liked him for the most part.,good
103621,"most tests had uncovered material, that wasnt found in book or in lextures. I studied hours for tests and was boarderlinning a C-, the Final wasn't as tough as all the tests, overall this class was hard, i learned alot although my final grade reflected a C+",average
103621,He might know the material he is teaching but he is terrible at getting that information to me the student. He tells you to remember things that aren't on the tests. If you enjoy teaching yourself biology and wasting time in his class and then teaching yourself through the book you'll LOVE this class. Worst class i have ever taken.,poor
103621,Not a terrible teacher. I thought he was ok. If you think his class was hard and you are a biology major than i would recomend changing majors cause his class was one of the easier classes I had.  He is a little scatter brained but he explains what you need to know,average
103621,"I really love biology, but Whaley ruined it for me. His tests are ridiculously stupid, he tries to be sneaky, but it just comes across as confusing. I HATED his teaching style, he goes through dozens of powerpoints in a class just reading off of them. It almost seems like he has no idea what he is talking about. I had a very negative experience",awful
103621,I learned a lot in his class. He gave fair warning of what would be on his test. If you study the given power points with the text book in hand you will learn the information. If you don't go to class or don't pay attention you will not do well. This is the nature of Biology.,good
103621,"Great teacher.  Tests were not the easiest, but he made sure to cover the material and also made it clear you need to read the chapters or you have no chance.  He is one of the best teachers I have had I would take a class from him for sure",good
103621,"He's not the best at explaining stuff so you'll end up reading the book half a dozen times. His tests are l ike passing a kidney stone. seriously. If you are good at learning on your own, i'd recommend him. You'll like the way he puts stuff &quot;best hearing you'll ever hear.&quot; &quot;much more lesser&quot;",poor
103621,"His class was hard, i paid good money for a hard class i didn't want an easy A. His lessons were very confusing, it forced me to read the book ahead of him, and in doing so i learned the material very well. From my experience with other biology teachers, he is just as confusing as the rest. I WOULD RECOMEND THIS TEACHER TO PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY CARE.",average
103621,"Prof. Whaley is an insanely hard teacher. I even heard one of the hardest in the west, and it's very easy to believe. It's a hard course, no doubt, he expects you to study about 2 hrs per hour of class time, and you'll need every minute of it! He's hard but good. Most students who do well in his class go on to do well in the MCATs'.",average
103621,"Had alot to expound upon, does get behind and then rushes through to get caught up test were tricky sometimes but was fair.  Can't complain w/ an A-",good
103621,I didn't really see anything terrible about him. I didn't think his class was that hard.  His tests have some tricky questions but I have had way harder tests than his. He is always willing to help you with whatever you don't understand and is entertaining. His big fault is he is a bit unorganized.,good
103621,His tests are so hard.  I studied like crazy and I still failed this class.  I didn't really go to class because I didn't understand anything that he was teaching because he goes through it so fast.  He just says read it and then you'll understand it.  I wouldn't recommend him.,awful
103621,"He has got to be one of the worst teachers ever. The first day in class he says that if you want to do well on his tests that you have to study the text and the CD that comes with it. I took that to mean, &quot;I'm a terrible teacher and won't teach you a thing so your on your own.&quot; I was right.",awful
103621,"Professor Whaley delights greatly in the dimise of his students. The test on genetics was so unbelievable difficult and excruciating i considered sending hate mail to Dr. Whaley. Its almost that he wants us to learn to fail, rather than learn biology to become med students. Very dissatisfied with his teaching ability.",awful
103621,"Dr. Whaley cares more about covering the material than helping his studets to understand and learn. He does not answer student questions in a clear way, instead just restating what he said the first time(which caused the confusion in the first place) It almost seems that he wants his students to fail rather than succeed.  He is a horrible professor",awful
103621,"very bad teacher...arrogant, childish, selfish, unclear.  he actually made people in my class feel bad/stupid for asking questions - they wouldn't ask questions again after that. i got an A, you can if the text becomes your best friends and you are willing to put up with a dork/jerk for a teacher and &quot;jump through his hoops.&quot;",poor
103621,"Worst teacher at UVSC. I have had some bad ones, but he truly does not care about helping his students. I saw too many poor kids get torn a new one for asking something in class. Steer clear of this one if you want to get what you pay for with your tuition.",awful
103621,"Personally I like Whaley and his teaching methods.  He does make you work HARD for your grade though - I was taking 14 credits and studied about 50% of the time for his class.

He always asks if anyone has any questions. Somewhat frantic teaching methods, but entertaining. I would take him again.",good
103621,Whaley is a good professor.  I had a wonderful time in his class.  He helped me understand bio. If you want to learn something take his class.,good
103621,Goood teacher.  Really knows his stuff.  Really wants you to learn.,awesome
103621,I really enjoyed Dr. Whaley's class.  His way of teaching keeps you interested in the subject.  He genuinely cares about his students and wants them to learn as much as possible.  He does enjoy butterflies and if you can get him to talk about them it's worth you while.  what a great guy.,awesome
103621,"Very good teacher.  Please disregard comments made by people who probably shouldn't be in any kind of biology course.  His classes are tough, but they should be.  I'm glad I was able to take him.",awesome
103621,Dr. Whaley has only one thin on his mind...Swallowtail Butterfies.  He's the world's foremost authority on the subject.  But he has very little time or patience for first year Biology students.  He has no interest in making sure you understand the material (very disorganized) and heaven help you if you ask a question in his class.  Caveat emptor!!!,awful
103621,I studied for countless hours and I still came out with a horrible grade. I went to class everytime and used every study method I could think of. If your not a genius don't expect to get a good grade in this class.,awful

103621,"unorganized, apathetic, and basically didn't seem to enjoy or understand how to teach the class at all. The school should only employ him to do research because he is not qualified to teach",awful
103621,Not very good. I would not recommend taking him.,awful
103621,I thought he was a great teacher!,awesome
103621,"Avoid this guy, he's a fool. All these people who say &quot;you just have to read the book and you'll be fine&quot; are right, but thats always the case in every class. Find a different teacher who can actually teach you something.",awful
103621,You must have missed class buddy. None of his lecture had anything to do with the test nor did we ever go over the tests. You are right about the tests being from the book but not as clearly as one would think.  Take this class elsewhere before coming,awful

1307460,I would never take this class-especially online. I have never seen someone who would never communicate with his students. I tried to contact him few times  and I gave up. I don't mind about lots of homework or whatever but he is one of the worst professors I have ever met in my entire life.,awful
1307460,"I would not recommend taking this course online. The teacher has a very structured and organized course. As well as a bunch of lectures that took him some time to make, so props to him. However, the tests are very hard to understand. If you take this class... study study study. Go over every thing. Especially the Chem section...",poor
1307460,"Took online. I hate his trick question quizzes and tests. I've gotten mostly 100% but I have to sit there for hours and analyze. He uses fancy vocab in his lectures with out defining his jargon words. He doesn't communicate at all with you through emails and such, not even if you use canvas. his links to learn more about concepts never work- EVER.",average
1307460,I would not recommend taking this class online. It was very difficult for me to understand the lectures. He requires his students to take the final exam at the UVU testing center so you really need to know what is going on in the class if you want to get a good grade on the exam. For now on I will be taking my science classes in person.,poor
1307460,Be prepared to spend half a semester stroking the ego of Charles Darwin only to have no questions about him on the final. This class was horribly structured and after studying all online materials I could find for a bio 1010 final I walked out of the test blindsided by the 3000 level questions. Not to mention he never responds to emails.,awful
1307460,"If you're unlucky enough to get this course, GET THE OPTIONAL TEXTBOOK. The teaching model is poor, with ridiculously long reading assignments, and 3 question quizzes over the material (quizzes are 25% of final grade).

1307460,"There is no book, just random websites he assigns you to read from. Instead of basing the tests on the information from the websites, the tests are based off of Biology textbooks that we don't use. Because of that, the tests are VERY hard to study for.  Also, the final was really hard (no study guide). The class average was 51/110.",awful
1307460,"Dr Parker is fairly nice and wants to help. He will answer questions that you ask in and after class. Grade comes from tests, but the lowest exam is dropped and replaced with top 10 quiz scores which is helpful. His tests are difficult. They are meant to trick you. Super ambiguous questions that leave you guessing even when you know the material.",poor
1307460,"I have nothing good to say about Professor Parker. As others have said, he didn't have anything to do with the course. To expound on that, none of his exams matched the course material he used (but did not create), and the final exam was mostly chemistry questions, which matched neither his stolen course material or his mid-terms exams.",awful
1307460,"Absolutely ridiculous class. Uses material and lectures from a different professor, tests are arbitrary and impossible to study for, the final was super heavy on one section of material, and, again, impossible to study for. Yes, I passed. Yes, I got a decent grade. But this class was way too much of a headache. Do not take from this professor!",awful
1307460,The material is copy pasted from a three year old course that he didn't even create and then tests us on material NOT from the online lectures (think BIOL 3000+ material). Written assignments are graded by a TA so he doesn't even do his own grading for ANY of the work. Why should I bother to put in effort into class when  my teacher doesn't?,awful
1307460,He isn't even teaching a class he put together. Its a 3 year old course from another Prof. He doesn't seem to understand the online system. Incredible amounts of reading assigned in a very short period of time. Tests cover the most minute details. This is not biology 1010. This is a 3000 level class. Do not take unless you literally have no choice.,awful
1307460,"I don't know where he gets the materials for everything, but quizzes, tests, and exams all seemed to have different information. I would get 100% on the quizzes and tests, and then get into the exam and walk out with a 50% feeling like it was all new information. He basically just reads off the slide shows he has prepared. It was a confusing class.",awful
1307460,"Seems like he wants you to learn bio, but does not want you to do well in the class. Lessons are general but tests are specific and cover things not discussed in class, they are loaded with trick questions. If you are a bio major looking for a challenge then he is great, but if you are just looking to get your 3cr GE bio credit then there is easier",average
1307460,"The workload in this class is ridiculous. You could easily spend 2 to 4 hours per day just trying to keep up with this class. The quizzes are very difficult, the exams are even worse. If you retake the quizzes the second set of questions is always harder than the first. I would not recommend anyone taking this class from him. I should have looked.",awful
1307460,The quizzes and tests are NOT based on lectures or reading... The only helpful information I found for this class was Quizlet... study for the exams using Quizlet and you will score will... if you actually do the work expect to be befuddled on the exams...,awful
1307460,"I took this course online after earning a C+ years ago on the main campus. I ended up with a letter grade lower the second time around. The course online is doable if you will set aside time to study. It's easy to do the assignments but the tests are more difficult. If you aren't a good test taker this class isn't for you,the final exam is tough!",average
1307460,This was my chance to retake biology (I passed several years ago with a C) I thought this would be an easy shot since I am in my third year and know my stuff. Not so!! The material was way harder than necessary and I didn't learn a thing. Doesn't let you go back to check answers on quiz and everything is on websites and 2 hr long videos on Darwin.,awful
1307460,Not book based teaching.  All things expected to learn are from websites.  ,awful
1307460,"Really great teacher. I don't understand all the negative ratings. Every time I had a question he would stay after with me to help me understand it. If you go, take your notes, etc you should get an A, he tries to have everyone get an A. Lectures are long but he makes them fun. Really just don't be lazy. Great guy, great teacher, great class.",awesome
1307460,His tests are awful!  He writes his own tests but he shouldn't. so bad! trick questions galore! ,awful
1307460,The class is in a lecture hall so it's not super exciting. He did a good job being engaging though. It was a good review if you already know something about biology. ,good
1307460,DO NOT TAKE. Parker is a hard teacher. He doesn't work well with the students. Tests are tough. ,awful
1307460,"The test questions tend to be trick questions; he's just trying to get people to be better test-takers and read each question through thoroughly.  I personally thought the in-class clicker quizzes were the hardest.  But it's nice, because he dropped the 5 lowest assignments, quizzes,  and the lowest test.  He's good at explaining things.",good
1307460,AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!!!  He treats you like you are a lesser being and expects you to pass a timed 30 minute quiz that he is weeks away from covering the material and the quiz content is hardly on his slides and the chapter readings are about 100 pages each with fine print.  So good luck trying to find the answers on your own. ,awful
1307460,"Professor Parker makes a lot of comparisons with everyday things, which can get a little confusing. I basically teach myself Biology and we have quizzes all the time about material we haven't even covered yet.  It's not a hard class, but it can be quite stressful and inconvenient.",average
1307460,"He's a good teacher and explains things well. He tries to be funny (usually isn't), but at least tries to make the class relatively interesting. However, I wouldn't recommend taking the class because he tests you on material he hasn't taught yet. His lessons are about 2 weeks behind the tests and quizzes so you're required to teach yourself. ",average
1307460,"I'm not going to lie, this is a hard class. You have to know A LOT! But Professor Parker is a good teacher. He's really funny and is extremely nice and helpful when you have a question. You won't need a textbook other than for the LearnSmart assignments he makes you do. All of his tests are based off of his PowerPoints and old exams, so take notes!",average
1307460,Professor Parker is terrible. I was seriously confused the whole semester and when you ask questions he makes you feel really stupid. I would not recommend Professor Parker to ANYONE.  Tests are really hard and when you ask what chapters in the text book that are being covered he says all of them. ,awful
1307460,"Dr. Parker is great teacher. He's a little odd but gives interesting and relevant metaphors to help you with concepts. Lecture based--I did not even buy a textbook. Grades are 100% quizzes and tests, which I actually liked. Take notes and you'll do well. The many negative ratings surprised me; I would definitely recommend him.",good
1307460,"This class was not at all as bad as everyone said it was. Dr. Parker is actually a really good instructor; I learned really well from him. Tests are hard, but he gives you plenty of material to help you succeed, including lecture recordings and Power Point slides. Don't fear all the negative comments on here, I really liked Dr. Parker!",good
1307460,I didn't realize until now that I ended up getting a B+ in the class & I have NO idea how that happened because I only passed one test the entire semester. He walks and sweats and rambles the entire class. He reminds me of Kevin from the office: boring. He just lectures and only has exams so you need to study EVERYTHING in class. Do not reccommend.,awful
1307460,"This class was not easy. If you follow the course objectives and use the old practice exams (extensively), you'll pull off a good grade. It was a lot to take in, especially for someone who isn't majoring in science whatsoever.",average
1307460,"I thoroughly enjoyed this class. Dr. Parker is tough, but that's what helped me learn the material. He goes over everything really well and he spends plenty of time answering questions. He now records his lectures, provides you with all of his slides, and gives you some great materials for studying for his exams. He's loads better than people say",good
1307460,"Worst teacher ever! I have now taken this class twice and have passed both times, but not with a very good grade. Your grade is weighted by exams and quizzes, which are nearly impossible to understand. A friend of mine taking biology at BYU looked at one of my quizzes and said that it was harder than the test she had recently taken that day.",awful
1307460,"By far the worst teacher I have ever came across. Went to him several times and ask for help because I was struggling and he simply told me to 'Do better.' Test you on things you haven't covered yet, ramble on about nothing, no homework to help your grade, and no matter how hard you study the material, it's always different on the test. Horrible.",awful
1307460,"Doesn't respond to e-mails, rambles about nothing useful during class, doesn't follow chapter outline of textbook, grade is based solely on exams and a few quizzes - no homework to cushion grade or help with understanding of concepts. Nothing but a cause of stress. This class is the reason I no longer have a scholarship. I even had a tutor.",awful
1307460,"All you have to do is go to class and listen and you'll pass.  I got a B, if I studied or did the quizzes I would've been in the A range.  Tests are there to make you think and understand the concept not make sure you can memorize.  Use the practice tests and you'll score well on the test.",good
1307460,"Dont expect to pass his class. He is not a good teacher. He is on chptr 10 but, all the hmw to be done is online and they r on chptr 13.he wont mov dates. His test don't make sense. says his test r only on stuff covered in class &they're not. There is nothin on your grade but the exams. no homework no attendance just the tests.",poor
1307460,"HOrrible teacher to communicate with. Sent emails, canvas messages and no response ever!! How is a student suppose to communicate with the professor when he is ill. His lectures are hard and and test format is confusing. Only thing good about his class is that he records his lectures.",poor
1307460,"Professor Parker is SUPER HARD but he teaches everything you need in class. He expects you to know EVERYTHING from his class. Sometimes it is confusing but go to him and he will clear it up. FOR AN A:go to class, re-listen to his lecture till you know exactly what he say and how he says it. Test are from 80%current lect 10%past lect 10% 1610 book",awesome
1307460,horrible class. no class interaction just lectures the entire time. he goes on tangents all of the time but still expects you to know everything. his study guides aren't at all like his tests and he has a lot of work for you to do. He treats you all like you know everything already. it's nearly impossible to pass his class.,awful
1307460,"DON'T TAKE IT. Tests are tricky. There's no hw to cushion your grade. He takes your top 10 best quiz grades to replace a test grade, but even that doesn't help.  I had another Biology professor tutor me and she said the material he taught should be in advanced bio classes and he didn't make sense of his questions. Avoid him.",awful
1307460,"Dr. Parker seems as though he wants you to learn but his test questions can be difficult. Don't miss class and when you study for the tests, stress the details covered in class and on the powerpoints. Your grade will seem to be low because of your test scores but if you do well on the quizzes, your grade will be better than expected. Good luck.",poor
1307460,"He says everything that we're tested on is in his powerpoints. A lot of the time, things are not in the powerpoints or they're in powerpoints that we haven't even covered yet. So things that haven't been introduced in class (or the powerpoints he's gone over) are on the tests. He gets annoyed if you ask questions in email, or doesn't answer email",poor
1307460,"The worst biology teacher I have ever had. He's rude to students questions in class. Tests are extremely hard, and questions are very poorly written. Quizes are hard but if you work in groups you'll be okay. Is a horrible teacher. This class could be really cool, but because you spend the entire semester trying to figure out what he wants its not.",poor
1307460,The worse professor at UVU. He should not teach. He doesn't care about students nor your learning. He is lazy and will not answer your questions. Studying will not help and listening to lectures won't do much either. He has tenure but needs to replaced fast. There needs to be another option for cell bio at UVU. Unfortunately will not learn much.,poor
1307460,"He is very vague, and then his tests are super hard. I have taken biology twice, including a college prep biology class in high school and still have no idea what is going on during the tests. Questions are worded weird and when he is asked questions about stuff in class he tells stupid stories instead of answering it coherently. AVOID THIS CLASS!",awful
1307460,"He is an average lecturer. He is pretty clear most of the time. Although most of what he tests on is taught in class he seems to stress things differently than the book. Some things he stresses are not even in the book. This class was difficult for me for this reason. Also, fill in the blank quizzes are vague and it is difficult to guess his answer",poor
1307460,"Horrible teacher, do not take him if at all possible. Choose another professor other than Parker. He makes his class and quizes easy and then when you think that you are catching on and you know your stuff, his tests come along and wipe you out and ruin any chance of a good grade. Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!",awful
1307460,"This class was an extremely easy one, literally all the material on the tests is covered in class, and explained in enough detail in class that if one pays attention you don't even need the book, I never had to study because it was just that easy.   t",awesome
1307460,Course lacks structure. Doesn't use the book very much and the lectures are aimless.  I have a 3.8 gpa all science/math courses (no generals) so I feel I know my stuff..don't take this class from parker.  Hardest (and not the good kind of hard where you actually learn) B+ I've ever gotten.,poor
1307460,"If at all possible wait until there's a better teacher you can take Cell Bio from. Doesn't test you on huge sections that he covers then asks for overly specific things on stuff he talked almost nothing about in class. Don't take from him, have have been warned.",awful
1307460,"Parker is one of the most intelligent professors I have ever been instructed by. He shares an extensive amount of knowledge with his students.  Sure, the tests are a bit difficult but college isn't supposed to be easy. Parker always advertises his ability to help one-on-one. This class is hard, but if you actually try you can get a lot from Parker!",awesome
1307460,Wait so what you talked about for 20 minutes wont be on the test but the 5 second mention of an additional protein will be a third of the test questions&#63;,awful
1307460,This professor is awful. DO NOT TAKE HIM! Unclear on everthing. tests you on material never discussed in the class. REAL BAD TEACHER,awful
1307460,He is a pretty cool teacher. He says that everything on the test or quizzes will be talked about in class which is untrue. He has a quiz every weekend that covers materials which are worded strngly and covers materials he has not talked about. He is a cool funny guy but his test is a little hard.,average
1307460,"His test is based on what he talks about in class. He posts old tests, and his power points he goes over in class all on blackboard. He explains it in a way that can be understood. he drops the lowest quiz grade, and test. I liked the way he taught, probably best teacher i have had.",awesome
1307460,"I would recommend not getting the book, his tests are on the things he talks about in class.  He dumbs down his lectures so you feel like you have a grip on the material but he doesn't dumb down the tests.  He goes into way more detail than necessary. With teachers like him it's no surprise that Biol 1010 is the most failed course at UVU.",average
1307460,"A teacher so bad he was hung in effigee by students. Test material is not found in book or covered in class. It's easy to feel like you know what's going on in lectures but when it comes time for a test, quiz or anything else you are going to be graded on it's another story. Asking questions is futile. He dodges them. Take Bio from Bybee or Harris.",awful
1307460,At any cost do not take this teacher. you will learn nothing but yet somehow its really hard to get a good grade.,awful
1307460,"Horrible teacher. He was unclear about what the tests were on and the tests were awful. Extremely hard class, DO NOT TAKE IT!! I usually get A's and i got a D. Do not take this class.",awful
1307460,It is just a hard class in general. He only tests on what he lectures on though. No surprises. He even posts tests from the previous semester that help a bunch with studying. He offers to sit down with each student individually to help you out if you need it.,good
1307460,His general biology course is fairly difficult. Makes you memorize specific things that are useless. 25 minute 'recap' of what we learned last time. Only really learning 25 minutes of new content each class,poor
1307460,"I really liked this teacher. He was very clear, and though there is a book, you don't need it. The only things on the test are from lecture. Take notes. He always reviews what last lecture was about, so it's nice if you miss. Open note/book quizzes on BB. Just go to class, take notes, and study the exam objectives. You'll at least get a B.",good
1307460,worst teacher ever. i went to almost every class and copied the power point notes word for word. i read the chapters and made note cards for every test. i would study for hours and failed most of them. none of the material learned in class is on the tests. it was horrible. i normally get all a's but got a c in this class.,awful
1307460,I had this professor last semester and he was awesome. For those that complain that it was hard I can only say get over it. Biology is hard and if you thought 1010 was hard wait until you get to upper biology you will kill yourself. The test were hard  but he does a good job preparing you and he does teach what is going to be on test!,awesome
1307460,he's a really nice guy and when you go to class it seems like it won't be super hard if you pay attention and take notes. but when you take tests and quizzes you realize that almost nothing that was discussed in class is on the tests. EVERYTHING is from the book. the only way to get a good grade is to memorize the text book.,poor
1307460,"Biology is a really hard class in general I think he's a pretty funny guy, he helped me when I needed it. The tests are difficult and the quizzes he gives every week were also difficult, you really have to know the information he teaches and if you don't know ASK and read ahead in the book. I liked him as a teacher but biology is just a hard class.",poor
1307460,"My advice: STUDY!!!! his tests are extremely hard. He quizzes you on things he hasn't taught yet so you're gonna have to read the textbook. You're only graded on quizzes, 3 exams, and the final. The good thing about this class is there's no homework. Just study hard. I'm lucky if I even pass this class.",poor
1307460,"Frustration is the theme of this class. Lectures are barely useful. The test questions were in fact written by Hitler. Condescending looks and answers to your questions are typical. I managed an A, no thanks to him, I just neglected friends and family for 3 months to study. Boycott this &quot;teacher&quot; he contributes to Americas poor education. HORRIBLE.",awful
1307460,"Horrible teacher. Lectures were often irrelevant to tests and quizzes. Your text is your only hope for a good grade. Tests are very specific lectures are very, very vague. I went to talk to him on two occasions over a concept I was struggling with and was met with rudeness and disrespect.",awful
1307460,"Unpleasant expereince! Very poor teaching style. Teaches casually, but tests VERY specifically. Don't take this class from this teacher. He has so little trust in students and plans teaching and material around that. Please be aware if you are an &quot;A&quot; type student.",poor
1307460,"Biology is a difficult subject--but he did a great job explaining it.  He was always there after class if you had questions.  He also warned you what he tested on.  Those who thought this class was beyond difficult must not have realized what to expect for any biology class.  I learned a ton, but it wasn't easy.  It did help he did several quizzes.",awesome
1307460,"I really Liked Dr. Parker, he is a tough professor, but it does pay off especially if you want to learn something!  If your in school just to get grades don't take him.  If your here to learn, and grow, and to really become informed on the subject of biology, well then Dr. Parker is great!!",awesome
1307460,"This was the worst teacher ever! I went to class everyday, wrote notes word for word then re-wrote my notes, read the chapters, then studied the study objectives and still only got a C+. He sucks. Words can't even describe how terrible he is. Do not take this class.",awful
1307460,just get out of the class while you still can. i'm a straight a student and i barely passed the class. i studied at least eight hours a week and still did terrible in the class. just dont waste your time or money for this class. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GUY!!!!!!!,awful
1307460,"He is a good teacher, and the lectures are easy to understand. He teaches what we need to know but doesn't help how to study. The lectures and study guides are unorganized. His students are responsible for making them in order & organizing to get good scores for the tests.",good
1307460,"Definitely not an intro to biology class. Tests are WAY hard and that is the basis of your whole grade. There is one research paper, which he grades harshly. He never returns emails. Could quite possibly the worst professor at UVU. He definitely ruined any interest I had in any science field.",awful
1307460,Parker is the most worthless teacher I have ever had. I have emailed him several times and never get anything back. He had surgery this semester and we had a sub for over a month who was WAY better then him. He takes forever to explain one concept and has analogies he uses that make him sound like a retard and they make it was harder to understand.,awful
1307460,"AVOID AT ALL MEASURES. Seriously, I saw his reviews and still thought that i could handle his class, but i couldnt. He is so unclear about everything he teaches, and when you do understand a subject, it isnt on the test. The tests are so hard, and i think my class averaged a 62% on one test. If you are looking for a good grade, then abort the missi",awful

1307460,"I had his class. I enjoyed and learned much. We were supposed to study 2 hours for every hour in class. But when I actually did do that, it didn't help whatsoever. The paper wasn't too bad. I honestly don't know how the hell I got a C+ in his class. I still don't know what I got on the research paper or the final to this day. Oh well, the classisov",average
1307460,"worst teacher, just stay away from him",awful
1307460,"He is a nice guy, but that's about the only good thing I have to say about him. All you have to study with for the tests are his lectures, which have nothing to do with the tests. His tests are impossibly hard. To top it off all that your grade is made of is three tests and the final. You are MUCH MUCH MUCH better off with any other teacher.",awful
1307460,"Dr. Parker is very nice,very intelligent. However, he teaches as if he was at an Ivy League University and as if we were all biology majors at an Ivy League University. What is discussed in class has almost no relevance to what is on the tests. Unless you are a science nerd avoid his class. He needs to work on his teaching skills.",awful
1307460,I am a straight A student and I pulled a D in his class. I tried to study for the life of me for his tests but did not help at all. His tests are very hard and his lectures in class do not pertain to any importance to the information on the tests. almost no homework a very confusing man.  verty nice and very intelligent but doesnt know how to teach,awful
1307460,"Parker is a nice guy all around. However, his teaching skills are terrible! He just stands up there and lectures to you like you already know what the heck he is talking about. Looking back on the semester I should have missed all his classes, read the book, and I would have received the same grade. He puts useful powerpoints on his blackboard.",awful
1307460,This professor is extremely useless to the idea of teaching your students what a joke. please find someone else dont get this joke you will regret every moment. wheres the fired button.,awful
1307460,"Parker was RIDICULOUS.  He lectured with out powerpoint the first 3/4 of the course.  His analogies are so ridiculous that everyone ended up more confused! In addition, His tests were ridiculously hard and confusing.  If you have to take BIO 1010, let him be your LAST RESORT for a professor!",awful
1307460,"No required text, all lecture based, classes are usually 100+ students so questions aren't very effective. Not much homework at all, however grade depends on 3 or so quizzes, 4 tests and a research paper. Tests are HARD!",awful
1307460,I do like his personality and way of teaching. His tests are half info from class and half knowing how the entire WOLRD works! I did learn some from his class because I had to work my butt off to even get a 65% on the tests. He does normalize which is how I pulled a C. But I am a straight A student! He is hard to get ahold of out of class.,poor
1307460,"Parker is a good guy just a crappy teacher, impossible to get a hold of. If you try to talk to him in person he just says email him, when you email him he never replies back. His tests are extremely difficult! Only nice thing is you have no homework. You do have to write a 3-5 page essay one time in the semester. He's definitely a terrible teacher!",awful
1307460,DONT TAKE THIS CLASS PERIOD! WORST TEACHER AT UVU!!!,awful
1307460,This class was way rough. I never missed class and still had no idea what he was talking about. He is very hard to get in contact with and when you do contact him is isn't very nice or helpful at all. I wouldn't take this class if you don't know anything about bio because he jumps right into things and moves very fast. The tests are very hard!,poor
1307460,Professor Parker is really hard!  All his material comes out of his lectures so missing class is not an option.  I had to miss several classes due to my daughter's health problems and Professor Parker would never return my emails.  I had a really difficult time with this class.,poor
1307460,"This is one hard class and Parker is not the easier professor to take it from. His tests come out of his lectures so I thought taking notes would be enough, but his tests are REALLY hard. I'm a straight-A student and will be hoping to pull a C out of this class.",average
1307460,"Bruce is a nice guy, very knowledgeable about his subject, and good at explaining it.  He assigns a very light load of homework, and only does a few quizzes throughout the semester.

He makes it a lot more complicated than it should be.",average

1141164,I enjoyed Weber as a teacher. He rekindled my love of math.,awesome
1141164,"Mr. Weber is not a bad teacher. He doesn't grade fair, if you have to make up a test he grades it himself and is a lot tougher than the grad students that do it. In lecture he will answer questions but makes the person feel stupid. Lectures are slow because no one will answer. My adviser told me she had heard from a bunch of students he is not good",poor
1141164,"If you walk into class with a bad attitude, it's going to be hard for you. He is one of the best math teachers I've had. If you ask questions during class he goes through step by step. His tests are tough but if you put effort into the homework, you will be okay.",good
1141164,"If you begin with a negative attitude in the class, either pertaining to the professor or the material, he will pick up on it. If you are negative, the class becomes ten times harder. If you work to be friendly and participate, Mr. Weber will become your best friend. I passed this class with flying colors and found it quite easy.",average
1141164,"A very hard class if you don't put the effort in. If you do try, it's not too bad. Weber offers a book with all the notes and in order to succeed I suggest you buy it! He goes through that thing the whole year and if you have it you will do a lot better. Overall average teacher, but you have to work hard to do well.",average
1141164,"His teaching style isn't all that great. If math is not your strongest subject, you probably will struggle.",poor
1141164,Didn't teach. Makes fun of you when you come in for help.,awful
1141164,"Weber is a good guy, it sucks that he's a terrible teacher. This was his first time teaching this class (History of Math) to the best of my knowledge, so maybe I just had a bad experience off that. He's a tough grader, it's really hard to tell what he wants sometimes. ",poor
1141164,"Bill is not a nice person to meet with in office hours. I realized after 5 visits that I was wasting my time. Get a tutor, get through the class and don't look back. He's also the department head for college algebra, so I'd advise taking any retake at LCCC Albany because I retook Webers class once after failing and failed the second time. ",awful
1141164,Best math teacher I've ever had. ,awesome
1141164,"Mr. Weber is a fine teacher. He has high expectations and getting to know him can be challenging in such a big class. If you are struggling and want to succeed I recommend visiting him in office hours. One on one he is kind, supportive, and one of the best math teachers I've ever had. ",awesome
1141164,Many of these comments are unfair. Professor Weber is incredibly knowledgable and supportive. It is important for students to make an effort. Weber respects students who work hard and put time into his class. I recommend going to office hours and paying attention in class. Classes are large so it's important to make yourself known... in a good way!,awesome
1141164,"Mr. Weber is incredibly helpful. Students need to put forth the effort, visit him in office hours, pay attention in class. If you are respectful and work hard than this class will be great. ",awesome
1141164,"I don't think the other reviews are fair at all. He isn't rude only to those who disrespect him in class like talk or have their phone out in plain site.  I do recommend going to every class. You'll be good if you're there, follow along and take notes in class. He is VERY helpful if you go see him during office hours!",awesome
1141164,"He is a very interesting grader. If you like to get perfect grades on your assignments it probably wont happen in this class. You pretty much copy down whatever he writes on the board but don't do any examples. Online homework is very easy, but test are hard as you didn't do examples at the caliber of the questions on the test. Poor class.",poor
1141164,"Weber is a good professor if you can live up to his type of teaching style. He's extremely rude though if you are to ask a 'stupid' question. I took this class twice, and still didn't pass with a C. I had peers that were in for their 3rd and 4th attempts. Take this class online through LCCC or EWCC.",poor
1141164,Difficult but here are my suggestions: Attend ALL lectures&fill out his course packet. Be polite to him. Ask for help after class and in office hours. Write down all your work for online HW even if you aren't doing the notebook. Do the ENTIRE study guide and practice test to study for exams. If can do those comfortably you're set.,good
1141164,"Dr. Weber really does try to help his students, but is very rude if the student asks a question that is 'stupid' in his opinion. He teaches formulas and rarely does more than one example of a concept. I have learned more from Kahn Academy than from him. I would not suggest him to anyone. He grades very difficult.",poor
1141164,Most comments put forth about this teacher are pretty accurate. The prereq for this class was as easy A for me. I then get brutally savaged by the first test. My primary complaint is his inability to teach what you need to know for the test. I took my W and will be retaking it with a foreign student as a teacher. Yes Weber is that bad.,poor
1141164,Is a really nice guy you just have to understand him! Good humor. Course is incredibly difficult for a 1000 based course! If you need help seek office hours. If you attend class and put in work you will pass with a C. Don't expect much higher! Lectures are very boring. Exams tough (40 % of grade)! Homework easy (half is online).,average
1141164,terrible teacher. monotone...boring...just writes as you copy... no practice in class... test way harder than any problem on homework or in class. stay clear!,poor
1141164,Once you understand the Professor's sarcasm it becomes a lot easier to talk to him and receive help.,awesome
1141164,"The material Weber puts on his test are entirely far off from what is covered in class and on assignments. He frequently made mistakes when demonstrating problems on the chalk board that, on a test, would lose a student all credit points.",awful
1141164,He gives fairly good lectures up until the sections become complicated. Can be very rude to students after poor exam grades and can be downright arrogant when talking with students 1 on 1. Does NOT prepare you for exams and does not give you a good idea of what material will be on the exam. Loves to 'massage' equations a little bit too much...,poor
1141164,"He's a terrible teacher, the homework system is awful. He doesn't make anything clear, and the tests are hard compared to the homework (which isn't lenient to mistakes). DON'T take this teacher.",poor
1141164,I felt that the homework was simple yet the tests were hard compared to what we were taught in class. I felt he didnt care about the sucess of his students. I did not enjoy this class because of him.,poor
1141164,Not helpful at all... Tests are very difficult while class lecture examples are very simple in nature.,poor
1141164,"It would seem that Bill's idea of teaching is to dumb the lectures down as much as possible so that the students think they're understanding the material, but then to give them horrendously hard tests in order to create artificial bell curves.  Very state-school.  Hopefully deans  et al. can see through such tactics which constitute poor teaching.",awful
1141164,"Sorry, but for someone of his stature in the UW math department methinks Mr. Skeletor here takes himself way too seriously.",poor
1141164,this oddball really took his liberties with the exposition of the material in class-- none of which lined up with what he expected from us on the tests and homework.  the 'textbook' was equally worthless to this end so I among many other students were just lost most of the time and were powerless to do anything about it...*sigh*.,awful
1141164,"Condescending and disrespectful towards students. Not recommended, obviously.",poor
158088,My guy Kenneth is a god man. The guy really gives out open book pop quizzes that show you what's on the final/midterm and are free extra credit points for the final/midterm. If you do well on the first paper don't worry about the second one. A lot of people give up after the third week. Just show up to class and try on the final/midterm. Ull BeFine,awesome
158088,"This is a difficult class, but do the work and you will pass. This class is based on a curve so if you beat the curve then you will be fine. He is a great professor and is willing to help if you ask for it. Many people stop coming to class or don't pay attention at all. Take the class do the work and pass!",good
158088,"Class lectures do not have anything to do with textbook reading. He talks about sports cars and tells funny stories but he's off topic. Homework is 800 point quizzes (sometimes 1200 points) and difficult because you must teach yourself the material. Class is curved. 2 exams, several quizzes, 2 book reports. Proceed with caution.",poor
158088,"This online course is horrible. He communicates through Twitter (what? Like you are Donald Trump?), never reply emails or discussion board. The homework and quiz are nightmares, a lot of mistakes and he never correct them. Google his name and you'll understand that he doesn't have time to teach! He is busy doing other business call sex tourism...",awful
158088,He Aight,awful
158088,"My friend and I (straight-A students) got 14% on the final. Luckily, with Ng's generous (though questionable) curve, we received A's. Advice? 'Select All' on homework, and rekindle your relationship with God, because you're going to be praying to him a lot during the semester.",awful
158088,"Whatever you do, don't take this class! I did not listen to the comments and regret it. Choose a different professor.",awful
158088,"Very knowledgeable about the subject. Goes off topic, but covers everything. Gives good life examples. Class is not very fun, but if you write the papers (a well written paper) and try on the homework, you can pass. He curves to the class average, so if you try you can pass. Not the best professor, but if you try you can pass with at least a C.",poor
158088,Just google his name. It's mind blowing that this guy is even allowed to teach given his unethical outside of work activities. He wants to see his students struggle and makes the exams overly confusing for what appears to be his own enjoyment of watching people struggle. Avoid and take an Econ class where the teacher actually wants to teach. AVOID!,awful
158088,"While he may know the subject matter well & is knowledgeable, he often interjects his own opinions and views about things. While I don't agree with his opinions and views on certain things, I ignore those statements and comments from him. Homework generally has multiple right answers, so read carefully.",average
158088,Very tough class for 100-level econ but if you're interested in economics it's well worth it. Several people including myself still receive A's because a majority of the class doesn't try. The curve is the only way to get an A. That being said I like his personality. He has a realistic view of  the world which is a cliche for econ professors.,good
158088,"Insane amount of homework, no help when you're online, for the love of God never take this class. it will save you months of stress and anguish. Please stop supporting this fool",awful
158088,"His lectures are soooo long, and he gets off topic fast. He really like cars and motorcycles, so most of the examples will involve either. He gives out two papers that are worth most of your grade, then you have a mid- term and final. I didn't do the first paper, but did good on the mid-term and final and I still got a B, so he's not that hard.",average
158088,"his class was ok. his lectures were very long but everything he said would b on the quizzes and tests he gave. so u had to pay attention. he would try to be funny, it would work sometime but most of it were just eh. his voice is so monotone . im surprised i passed his class. his midterm and finals r based on books. ok if u dont finish. i didnt",average
158088,Somehow I got a B. Pro tip if you are taking his class online. Every time there is a question that allows you to give multiple answers choose every single one. It won't dock you for getting one part of the question wrong and you'll receive full credit on the problem.,awful
158088,Took OL. Prof Ng was nice and available during office hours. Has a gazillion resources for his online classes. Grading criteria and grades were very clear. You get what you earn. Video lectures is recorded class lecture. Very fair IMO. There were 3 pop quizzes. OL  exactly like in class. Cheap books. Moodle fully set up from the start.,average
158088,This guy's lectures are almost about anything but not Econ!!! Very boring lectures!!! The grading is very hard to understand.,awful
158088,"if you think you could pass this class through hard work, then good luck. the only way to pass this class is through the curve and only the curve.  i got an A tho",poor
158088,"He has way too many text books, his syllabus is and lecture notes are online is disorganized. It looks too overwhelming, I got lost.  He has an online textbook with a different title than what he has on the syllabus. It's nice he enjoys teaching, but it's more like talking about things that aren't related to economics at first part of semester. :(",awful
158088,"So I literally learned nothing in this course, but somehow passed with a B. I honestly just did all the online homework, and when it come to the midterm and final, I just filled in all the blanks(I learned nothing in this class so I wrote what sounded logical). Beat the curve and you'll pass the class.",awful
158088,WORST THING TO EVER HAPPEN! Also used to run a blog to assist people in picking up prostitutes in in Asia (underage ones too) Grades on a curve but this person shouldn't be allowed near a campus!,awful
158088,"The one good thing I have to say about him is he doesn't hide anything. He has everything on the page for his online class. But his lectures barely helped on the homework and barely did anything for the test. I basically had to teach myself. Would not take him again, given the option, choose another teacher, PLEASE!!",poor
158088,"Professor Ng is an Expert in the subject, he is extremely passionated towards his profession, He tries his best to make the class laugh, and to understand it using various life examples.

158088,He is confusing and tries to be funny. Received a D in the class. Some of my friends had better experiences. He does post everything online. He records his lectures so attendance isn't mandatory but your grade reflects your effort.,poor
158088,This is a warning for new students who want to take this class. His class is like freeway that every one entre and exit but your grade will be D or F. 70 students out of 110 failed and others got C and D. This professor final exam is bring 6 page papers and you have to analysis the paper then answer questions. Don't take if you don't want to be bad,awful
158088,I drove to this class without my seatbelt on every Monday and Wednesday,awful
158088,Very boring. goes off topic often and is a horrible professor,awful
158088,"He is very bad professor at CSU because he does not explain anything , and then he is demanding. His online HW I unrelated to his notes and text book. He has a online textbook that you have to pay for it at first of the semester, and this is a business for him. Also, his online textbook is very hard and nobody read it . ",awful
158088,"His lectures are about anything except Econ. Also, his absurd PowerPoint presentation is based on business, women sex, luxury car and then gives ridicule pop quiz at class that nobody knows about it. A funny things is that pop quiz point is 10 and whole class get 1 or 2. Don't take him.",awful
158088,"Went out of my way to tell you to not take this professor. Goes of topic, explains vaguely, expects you to know the material yourself. 2 term papers, 1 midterm and a final along with homework that's difficult. Wouldn't recommend.",poor
158088,"This professor is by far the worst I have ever had! And I have had pretty horrible professors. His lectures are awful, he goes off topic often, and it seems as if his lectures having nothing to do with the exams. Avoid this professor if possible!",awful
158088,"he is useless. if you MUST take it, just know you are NOT going to learn a THING, but you can DEFINITELY pass if you enroll in the lab so the TA can help you and review the tests and quizzes.

158088,Do. not. take.,awful
158088,"This class is just work, work, work. I am usually good with keeping up with assignments but the way this professor sets everything up is just confusing! I go to every lecture take notes and pay close attention but to me it seems like the exams are just so far off from the lectures! I am so confused in this class and I don't understand anything. ",poor
158088,"This is a very hard course and this teacher makes it even harder to pass. His lectures are long and he always goes off on a tangent and talks about irrelevant things. He grades the essay and tests by just putting your score on top of the paper; he does not tell you why you received that score, it makes you wonder how or if he even really grades it.",awful
158088,"If you do not go to class, you have a 99.99% chance that you will not pass! His lectures are long and boring. He often times goes off topic. He gives irrelevant essay assignments that have nothing to do what he is trying to teach us. The way he structures his test are confusing. Try and stay away from this professor. ",awful
158088,"Waste of my tuition!! Worst teacher ever in my 15 yrs in school, pointless term paperS Doesn't explain anything, he thinks people already know Econ so he doesnt lecture on it Talks about irrelevant things Hate him , don't waste your time with this useless person ",awful
158088,The only reason I recomend this class is because of the curve. When doing online and there are questions where it asks for multiple answers in one questions MARK EVERY SINGLE BOX! you will get full credit for that question! You will learn absolutely nothing in this class. Just beat the curve and you will do fine. I got an A and didn't read anything,awful
158088,"This is an extremely hard course. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Probably 60% of the class ended with a non-passing grade.  You have to do many online quizes online, and MOST OF THE TIME IT IS NOT RELATED TO THE LECTURES.... Quizzes would take up to 6 hours for 55 questions with at least 2 people and yet you will score if you're lucky a B grade on them. ",poor
158088,Took him online. DO NOT TAKE. He expects too much reading. Didn't learn from online and he never replies to emails. ,awful
158088,"This teacher is terrible. The lectures are unclear, the work has no direction. The homework is all objective but yet there is still right and wrong answers... There is no help from him. The worst is when there are wrong questions on the tests and homework, that is pointed out by the students EVERY time. Do not take this class!!!",poor

158088,"EASIEST CLASS EVER! This class is not hard, just atten the lecture. Homeworks are easy. you do not really need to read. I did not read throughout his course any book he assigned, just skimmed them when term papers were due and I received the third highest A. My advice, GO TO CLASS and you will pass!",good
158088,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF!!!  Look elsewhere.  Took the online class, got SO confused.  Monotone, doesn't explain whats on the tests, just references old tests that he posts on moodle but even still the old tests doesn't give you answers, you have to do the work and hopefully you get it right.  Does not respond to questions, just refers you to his FAQ.",poor
158088,"Terrible professor. His lectures seem to not be related to the course. If he handed out a sheet of notes on the topic with examples, you would have a better chance of understanding. Class is curved, but doesn't change the fact that he is unclear and makes many mistakes in typing, grading, etc.",awful
158088,"This is the worst professor I have ever taken. Do whatever it takes to not take him. I went to every lecture, studied, got help and tried my hardest and that wasn't enough. He has a pathetic curve that doesn't really help you out. His lectures, homework, and quizzes don't go with one another. You are forced to figure it out yourself. DONT TAKE HIM!",awful
158088,"I believe you need to go to the lectures to have the slightest idea about Econ. The lectures do not help completely when it comes to the test; you have to also read and do some side research. The term papers are annoying, however, you do learn a lot from doing them. I would not take this professor if you are easily stressed. Try your best!",average
158088,"Not an easy class but study hard for it, and sit next to someone smart!! There is a logical way to think about Econ and an Economic way that goes into ECON Deeper.  Do the hw, read the books for the term papers (helps alot), and try your best for the group quizzes for extra credit with a group of other people.  You will do fine if you putin 110%!",average
158088,"Two term papers, multiple pop quizes. Lecture are unclear and feel as if they dont pertain to the course/book chapters",awful
158088,"Compared to other econ classes, it's not that bad because he curves and there many assignments to boost your grade. You will pass if you put in some effort because of his curve. However, he is not helpful at all. You will study yourself entirely. Go to tutoring and do well on his papers. Even though you won't really learn anything, you'll pass.",awful
158088,Worst instructor I've ever experienced. Does not provide clear instructions for his assignments. Quizzes have incorrect solutions and is reluctant to change them. He does not help you with assignments. Doesn't teach you economics; he shoves free market capitalism down your throat. He is monotone and boring. He is very condescending.,awful
158088,the class is hard... i dont recommend taking it online cuz theres so much to keep track of. he does curve but if you dont do the homework and the 2 term papers your grade will drop easily... i wish he gave feedback on midterms because its confusing to know what you got wrong/right.,good
158088,"I thought that this class was great. He gives a good economic perspective and is very clear with his class lectures. Be warned, there is a lot of reading. If you don't like to read or are looking for an easy, no effort class, take someone else. But with a little effort, an A is very achievable.",good
158088,"He was a good professor. Kind of monotone, but interestong nonetheless. He has a very VERY generous grading curve, it helps A LOT! He is pretty easy going and give chances to recieve extra credits on future tests through pop quizes.",average
158088,One of the worst professors I've ever had in my academic life! He rambles about himself and stuff that have nothing to do with MicroEconomics and sometimes he even comes in with powerpoints made about non-related stuff the course! For example motorcycles! and what bikes he used to ride when he was a kid.. don't even bother taking the class with him,awful
158088,DONT DO IT IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY. His main goal is to ramble about himself then trick you. He turns the simplest concepts into mind games and the answer is always 'it depends'. I learned more about the mans childhood than Econ. Don't do it.,awful
158088,Confusing as can be. Not Helpful at all. Tests are impossible,awful
158088,"DO NOT TAKE THIS PROF, The worst professor I have taken ever. He goes off on tangents and requires a term paper, His tests are difficult and tries to trick you. He seriously should be fired. I never write reviews but I really do not like this professor, IDK what any other student may say dont take him.",awful
158088,"He is the only professor I dislike.He likes rambling on about other things and then  makes a poor attempts to relate it back the subject. He believes CSUN students are incapable of surviving in a more 'prestigious' university, that is why he curves. Test are mainly from powerpoints and book. I got a B but it was not because of his great teaching.",poor
158088,"If you just want to pass Econ 160, I recommend his online class. As long as you attempt the online homework and do the term papers with effort, you should be able to get at least a B with his curve because so many people in online classes don't do/forget assignments. His midterm and final are hard, but even after doing horribly on both, I got a B.",poor
158088,"So, yeah, this class is incredibly difficult. Most of it is done online so you don't really have to attend, but if you do, it's 3 hours of pain from how hard the material is and pain from how irrelevant his discussions are and how he constantly goes off topic. Other than that, just study for the midterm and final and do the term papers. You'll pass",poor
158088,"Let me just warn you: Even with his crazy curves this class is crazy hard!!! I am regretting every single moment of it.Take it next semester with a better professor if he is your last resort! Makes subject difficult and I don't understand on top of that why he finds it amusing to trick us. If class average is below 50, something is obviously wrong!",awful
158088,Lectures are irrelevant and very unclear. Exams are extremely difficult and unrelated to homework or lectures. Do not take this class. I got a B but it was the hardest B I ever earned. Take this professor as a last resort,poor
158088,"So confusing. I'm a junior and just received my first C. I highly recommend not taking him. He will give you old tests to study, they are of no use really. The questions on the tests will only resemble them but the actual material will be completely different. Professor Ng, please learn new methods of teaching. Also remember this is a 100lev class.",poor
158088,"Recipe for success from a NON-ECON MAJOR - in other words, someone who wants to pass - take the hybrid class, don't go to lectures except for quiz dates, do all of the online work, do the fairly simple term paper and exams - bam, you've passed. some questions he uses on tests are hard but c'mon he's not that bad. I love his off topic rants lmao.",awesome
158088,I learned a lot from Dr. Ng. The lectures were interesting with many examples that relate to true life. The extra books were fun to read. I never knew much about life in China or Russia before taking the class.,good

158088,DO NOT TAKE THIS PROFESSOR! His lectures are hard to follow and he goes off topic on these ridiculous examples. He does not apply the students for the assignments given and the live class is a waste of time. The work load is high and the grades don't reflect ones true knowledge of the material.,awful
158088,"It is mandatory to read the book for this class if you even want to pass! Most of his students fail but gives a big curve. Test are hard and confusing and don't resemble the HW. HW & Reading = Easy, Lecture & 3 Tests = Complicated.",poor
158088,"For the Love of your life do not take this professor, took him my first semester for 160 (micro-econ) and I passed with an A thanks to his term papers, but I decided to take him again for 160 (I had no choice thanks to my work schedule) and for 160 he HAD NO TERM PAPERS, unfortunately I failed!

158088,He is a good professor. take his class if you want an A. ,awesome
158088,"Great class. You have to read 4 books plus the textbook but the extra books, the term paper, and the lectures really go all together and teach you something about the world. I believe the students who don't like this class are the ones who never got what Ng is trying to teach because they didn't really read all the books or do all the assignments.",good
158088,"The tests are next to impossible and then extremely curved so that a 50 is an A. I got an A in the class and feel like I learned nothing. Anyone taking his class should be able to pass because of the huge curve. Lectures are vastly irrelevant to economics and at times borderline offensive, like explaining the best way to rob a small asian girl.",poor
158088,"Okay, he isn't the best teacher but there should be no reason to fail this class. The curve is huge & he gives many extra credit quizzes that are open book & you can work with others.

158088,"The only reason I passed was b/c i had taken econ 161 before transferring.He goes off topic constantly that i ended up sleeping in class.He wont tell you what you missed and has that smirk of looking down on you for not knowing.I suggest that if you have not taken econ before and his is the last available class, wait another semester.Not worth it",awful
158088,HORRIBLE TEACHER! very hard quizes and exams. he doesnt teach well I sit all the way in the front and I still don't learn because he gets off topic so much... he's   the only professor available for econ 161 next semester but I'm going to a community college just so I won't take him again. makes us read 4 books 1 of the books is over 500 pgs long!!,poor
158088,This dude cannot teach. He just talks the entire class and sometimes goes off on stories that have nothing to do with the topic. Take someone else if possible.,awful
158088,"When I read comments about this professor I was very nervous but had to take his class.  Well, I really liked the way he taught this subject.  It worked great for me to understand.  You have to be patient and pay attention to understand his points.  Those who are looking for an easy grade then do not take this professor.  Loved his teaching style.",good
158088,This class is a simple case of doing better than your peers. Everything is graded based on the whole class average. Do the homework it helps your grade. He makes you read 3 books!smh. 2 term papers on the books. His tests are so hard its ridiculous. Most of the time the average was around 30/100 and im not exaggerating.Take someone else if possible,poor
158088,I found that most people who complain about this professor simply didn't do their homework. Nor did they ask for help during his office hours. If you just do the homework (and its pretty simple stuff) the exams will be a breeze. Either way he grades on a pretty generous curve. If you just read your book it's almost impossible to get below a C.,good
158088,"He's useless as a teacher but he grades on a curve. So you just have to do better than the rest of the class. Homework is done on Aplia, do it! It's the only way you can learn. (You have to be able to teach yourself the material and Aplia is the best way to do that). Don't get upset if halfway you have an F, grades change dramatically in this class",poor

158088,"AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!
 
 I took Professor Ng last year and it was a big mistake.  Lectures that ramble off topic, few references to the book and even with perfect attendance very little learned.  This is what I got from Mr. Ng's class with near perfect attendance.  
 
 I wasn't alone as the majority of the class did poorly, which is why Mr. Ng grad",awful

158088,If u cant teach yourself dont recommend this class his lectures confusing more than anything unless he goes off topic than interesting. Test extremely hard and not related to homework its like math with an essay test doesnt really make sense. Got a 32% on one test and did better than evryone sitting around me. dont recommend.,poor
158088,"He is absolutely incompetent, he does not teach properly which is why most of his class is failing and his tests are ridiculously hard. He gets off topic a lot and talks about poker and other stupid things...he does not teach so avoid this class for sure don't take it.",awful
158088,"Can anyone tell me how someone can be called a teacher when the average test scores are in the 50s and upper 40s&#63;  He does not know how to teach which is why he uses a curve.

158088,"ok this doosh's class really sucks. his pop-quizzes, all the exams and the final are irrelevant to the lectures. you never use the book. assigns an online HW system, which hes too lazy to give out HW and review anything. the class avg was below 65%. he sucks and he always has a gay ass smirk on his face. DONT TAKE THIS CLASS. U WILL REPEAT!!!!!!!",poor
158088,One word: AWFUL! He gives you previous lectures and exams so at first I thought it would be a peice of cake. I was WAY wrong. His lectures are pointless - he usually gets off topic talking about RANDOM things that have NOTHING to do with econ. Never uses book. Writes his own examines and is very objective. Do not take this professor!,poor

158088,test questions have nothing to do with lectures.  he might know a lot about econ but he is not a teacher.  avoid,poor
158088,worst teacher at csun. avoid taking him.  test questions have nothing to do with the lecture.  test questions are very missleading.  you do not know if he wants you to answer questions by using the graphs or by using the text on the test.,awful
158088,the material was very interesting but he needed to slow down.  he did not care about the students.  he never wanted to answer questions and when someone would ask a question he would just give a fast answer and continue with his lecture-lecture was just reading/going over the powerpoints as fast as he could.,poor
158088,"NOT AS BAD AS EVERYONE SAYS HE IS! The people here giving him low ratings are just dumb asses who won't graduate CSUN.

If the Econ department lets him keep teaching - how can they possibly be concerned with the quality of their students learning experience&#63; He was NOTHING LESS than OFFENSIVE with comments that degraded women and overweight people. I think he may seriously need help teaching, he just cant do it!",average
158088,one of the easiest class. got an A. he gives he extra credit on all the midterms by giving out quizzes. quizzes can raise your  score on the midterms as much as 15 percent. just do all his online hwk. read the chapters when he assigns them and review his slides before the tests and you should receive an A. plus his curves mean 70% on test is an A,average
158088,Class was fairly easy. attendance was not required but gives you about 2 extra credit quizzes randomly for each midterm and the final. so be at class and take those quizzes and it could raise your test grade by a letter. just read the chapters and study his slides and you'll do fine. he also curves. 72 percent earned an A on one midterm,average
158088,this guy cant teach..he shows pictures of stupid cars and purses..his tests have nothing to do with the homeworks..he didnt even know when the final was all he said was just look online..the material is hard and it takes a good prof for a person to a understand it and this guy just sucks..avoid him,awful

158088,"Boring long lectures that have more to do with stupid random examples about gambling, cars, and Fatburger. It's not that hard of a class though, because the curve means a 65 to 70% on the tests = an A. Go to class because he gives out extra credit pop quizes that really help your grade. Do the aplia homework and print out power point slides.",poor

158088,I had this prof. in 1992. I CANNOT believe he hasn't changed. It was the worst class I have ever taken. I am a 4.0 student and he was the only C I have ever received in my life. I am now a teacher and know what good teaching is all about. He is one of the worst teachers I have ever experienced!,poor
158088,"omg this professor is freaking easy, yes his tests are sorta tricky but you just need to know how to BS your way thru the exams. I got a D on the 1st test, A on thn 2nd and A on the final.

158088,BEST ECON PROF AT CSUN.  He'll teach you how to 1. Solve World Hunger with Economics 2. Cheat in Pool/Vegas 3.And a whole lot about economics.  The Aplia assignments online are tough but if you come to each class he gives you EXTRA CREDIT QUIZZES that count towards the tests.  Her curbs the tests too. I got an A!  2 Midterms + 1 Cumulative Final.,awful
158088,Very helpful teacher. Illustrative lectures. Friendly. Scores based on curves.,good
158088,He's not interactive in his lectures; they are more like presentations. He often spends too much time on his irrelevant examples. Stay the whole class and U will be rewarded with pop quizzes that R added to the tests. U can keep the quiz & get the answers online. Most questions on the quizzes are on the tests.  The curve is GREAT. Do the homework!,good

158088,"GOOD LUCK!  3 tests (including final), and a few extra credit quizzes (you'll need it).  Attendance does not matter, however if you miss quiz day you don't get any extra credit points.

158088,This has to be one of the worst teachers at csun. The guy is the most boring and unhelpful teacher i have come across.

His response to hearing and knowing that 2/3 of the class will get a D or lower was &quot;well its not my fault if students do not want to learn.&quot; I was able to pull off a passing grade in the class with lots of tutoring.,awful
158088,"do not take him for econ 310OL. horrible course. thank god the econ department has a different professor teaching it next semester. only 1 A out of 60 online kids, because he averages the online class with his regular class -they didnt get lectures with messed up audio.",awful

158088,The Midterm was pretty easy. MC straight out of the boook. Anyone who didn;t well obviosly didn't study much. The curve was pretty forgiving too. Only 70% needed for an A--which I got. :),awesome
158088,Horrible Professor.  I received a 34 on the mid term.  After the curve this was a C.  Homework given through the Aplia web-site did not apply to the text book.,awful
158088,"I don't know what the &quot;cooling off&quot; thing is, but the lectures are hilarious--going to class is like going to a comedy club. Besides, how hard can the lectures be&#63;--they are multiple choice right out of the book.",awesome
158088,This guy should not be teaching. My advice to all of you: don't go along with that one week cooloing off period policy. We all deserve to be heard by our professors ANYTIME we have a problem. That's what we pay them for.,awful
158088,No Comments,awesome
158088,"The class is hard but the prof. is good at explaining things and the exams are very straightforward. He gives you the old exams so if you study, getting a good grade isn't hard--if you work on it. The notes are also available online so you son't have to t",awesome
158088,He is a funny guy if you can handle sarcasim! Study hard though!,awesome
158088,"I actually liked him, got an A, pretty funny too.",awesome
158088,dont ever take this teacher. His powerpoint unclear. The multi-choice test longer than others econ teacher 60 questions no calculator (sucks). His online homework worth alot of poit but the hardest questions. What a waste of time taking his class.,awful
158088,"this guy is one of the biggest idiots alive. he mumbles about a lot of crap as he goes on and expects u to know everything. you ask him a question its like cursing at him he gets ticked off. he is HARD! he curves the class just so people pass, a monster.",awful
158088,"He is the worst professor I have ever had. Refuses to help anyone. Luckily for the curve, the class is passable but other than that, this guy is an idiot!",awful
158088,"refuses to teach. Answer is reight word for word, but he marks wrong because graph is off. On his slide he has &quot;Standard one week cooling off period after the test&quot; before he will talk to you.",awful
158088,"He's really funny, but the team-teaching/part online setup was very bad.",good
158088,STAY AWAY. nothing he says makes sense! talks more about vegas and bikes then econ. lectures suck- all on powerpoint with him reading it line by line. you should skip econ for a semester if he's your last choice. Aplia homework take tooo long!!!,awful
158088,"econ 310 and 311 have the worse passing rates, people like NG, are the reason why.  even though class is curved.  HE MAKES IT SO HARD.  i wouldn't recommend.",awful
158088,Tests are WAY TOO LONG in a short amount of time.. No calculators for simple calculations which really slow you down.  Says &quot;Ok&quot; After Everyother Word which can be REALLY annoying to have to listen to.. Wouldnt Really Recommend Him.. He is nice,poor
158088,"he usually teaches big classes, but his test are HARD. he curves, which means if you are smart, and work hard, you'll be fine. if you are looking for a easy way out, i wouldn't recommend him",average
158088,hard tests but curve is fair ended up with A but a lot of work to get the A,average
158088,Fascinating class!  I learned so much about US history!  Ng's really alot of fun.,good
158088,passing rate are low,awful
158088,DO NOT TAKE THIS GUY!!! You will regret it. I consider myself a pretty smart person. With the right teacher and minimum efforts...I can get a &quot;B&quot; in any class... but not this one. I would have received fails on both test if it werent for the cur,awful
158088,"Real difficult. His lectures have nothing to do with his lame, unnecessary difficult tests. If it wasn't for his big curve 80% of the class would have failed. 47 out of 100 was a B for me. Think about it and stay away from this horrible guy.",poor
158088,"One of the best professor's one can hope for.  Not easy, but if you don't miss his classes and pay close attention to his lectures you'll do fine. You learn a lot.His lectures are very interesting unlike many other professors' who put me to sleep.",awesome
158088,"If you are receiving your PHD in economics, then you might have a chance of getting a C in this class. His evil laugh reminds you of the wicked witch, except in this case you replace the W with a B. And just remember, NO CHANCE, thats what you've got!",awful
158088,hard tests... hard assignments.. hard essay questions. BUT NICE BIG CURVE at the end.,good
158088,Stay focused and you will do fine.  Don't miss assignments or points will be deducted from your grade.  But the homework and quizzes help you.  Do them and you can't go wrong.,average
158088,"Professor asks oddball exam questions that makes it difficult, if not impossible, to apply concepts learned in class.  WORST teacher I've ever taken.  Class average were approximately 38%.  I got a 47% on Exam 2, which was an A.  Very subjective grading.",awful
158088,No Comments,good
158088,"Very nice guy, speaks in a monotone voince and every other word is &quot;um.&quot; Tests are rather difficult, just use the CD that came with the book and you'll do fine.  Has some very funny lectures about cars, woman's clothes, counter-strike, etc.",good

319641,"Do not take him! Does not care about students and never clearly explains what he wants. He ridicules you instead about your paper, and rarely ever teaches. You will have to teach yourself.",awful
319641,One of the best prof in the Psych dept. He does care about everyone passing. Yes there are a lot of assignments but they are do-able. He is passionate about what he teaches and he will meet you half way if you actually try in his class. If you take things to the heart don't take him. I have had him for 2 classes already and will take him again.,awesome
319641,"If you want a professor who cares about you passing DO NOT TAKE HIM. He demeans you for asking a question, doesn't give instruction on what he wants for the research paper but will get mad if you don't follow his nonexistent instructions, wont answer emails or any questions, his 'sassy' comments are insults, and you have to teach yourself. AVOID!!!",awful
319641,He gets off topic a lot during lectures or he brings up topics that have no importance that makes the chapter more confusing. He can be funny but I understand how he can come off as rude. He gives a lot of assignments but let's you do them in class with groups. He lets you redo your exam to add onto your score which brings up your exam grade!,average
319641,"the good: funny, works with you every step of the way, gives good feedback.  the bad: blunt and borderline rude (he might be too much if you take criticism personally), semi-disorganized structure of the class (when was that deadline again?), unnecessary lectures (all he does is read off powerpoints).  be ready for independent studying.",poor
319641,"if you anticipate this class being difficult for you then be prepared to learn material independently. otherwise, this may be an easy A for you depending on how well you do on his exams. drops lowest exam, doesn't assign much hw, no extra credit opportunities, teaching style is very relaxed,forgets to post ppt slides sometimes so take notes or read",average
319641,"He is nice, but VERY DISORGANIZED. Mid-term NO ONE PASSED! So he let us retake the test  but with open book and in groups. Most of everybody studied for the test, but some questions were not clear and from chapters we haven't even seen or talk in class. He gave us credit for those questions. But I sincerely do not recommend this professor.",poor
319641,"The professor really has spider senses when you are off task (example on your phone) and he will call you out on it. Yes, he is sassy, but his class was great. We learned a lot, we laughed a lot and our exams were fairly easy. You just have to study.",good
319641,Funny sassy guy!  Lectures are long but okay.  He is easy.  3 tests and drops the lowest grade. He let's us share our personal experiences making the class funner.,awesome
319641,"Dr. Abara is a really fun and kind professor, some people might need to get used to his sassy personality, but he's a very fair grader and gives you the answers to the tests in his lectures. He keeps you awake and interested by cracking hilarious jokes, and genuinely cares about class feedback. Pay attention in class and try, and you'll get an A.",awesome
319641,DONT use your cell phones. if you have a laptop with you don't look at it often. make sure to pay attention to him more because 1. you will pass. 2. he has spider senses when someone is doing something else. great professor highly recommend. ,average
319641,This professor is amazing! Just dont get on his bad side because he would put you on the spot. Respect him by not texting in class. He is a good professor and i recommend you taking him. He inspired me to become a psy major. He has funny jokes and does not want to see his students fail. ,good
319641,"You can tell that he's a great guy, and his sense of humor was geeky and I loved it with every lecture. With that said,  his lectures are long and usually quite disorganized. There's only 3 exams throughout the class though, so there's little room for error. Even so, he takes the best 2 grades into account, discarding the 3rd. Difficult exams.",average
319641,"he can be monotone when he's not being hilarious. 2 midterms & 1 cumulative final, consists of commonly missed questions from previous 2. attendance is 10%, other 90% are exams + the psych project. really easy and straightforward, clear expectations. he'll give you a verbal study guide for exams,  study that and youll be fine. you dont need thetext",good
319641,"If you have half a brain, you'll take notes during lectures and do well on the tests. Not sure what all the other comments are about, one of my favorite professors at CSUN. Taught me a lot that I've used in grad courses.",awesome
319641," His tests are more based on his lectures than the book (which he told the class several times) its important to take notes on what he says. He can be stern if you piss him off, but he tries to lighten his lectures with jokes so i found it easy to follow. ",average
319641,Hard class but loved him! ,good
319641,I really was excited about taking this class and I left hating it. I would never take him again. His tests are extremely hard and idk where the questions are coming from. Not based on the textbook or lecture thats for sure. Ended up with a B and thats because everyone was doing so bad that he did an open book final but that won't save ur grade,awful
319641,I was very disappointed  in taking him for this  class. He was referred by another student who spoke highly of him.   He is not funny; he is condescending.  He does not lecture.  He comes in when he feels like it and then makes up some excuse. His tests are hard because he puts material that we have not been covered by him or in the text book.  ,awful
319641,Him being funny wears off after a week. I went into this class knowing it was hard & read all the chapters taking extensive notes & got C's on both exams. He curved not because we didn't study but because he messed up. On the 2nd of 3 exams he threw out 10q's because there was no way of us knowing them they literally were not in the booknotes! ,poor
319641,"Great Professor, doesn't want to see you fail unless you really deserve to.  Recognizes that the course material is rigorous and tries to ease the pain by offering open note test; at least that was the case in my experience.",awesome
319641,"Dr. Abara SAVED my semester! I was terrified to take PSY321 because math is just not my thing, but he was so helpful and always willing to go out of his way for you as long as you put the effort in. Loved his class so much, I signed up for his Capstone. Takes hard work and effort, but you'll def be glad you took him for this kind of class.",awesome
319641,One of the best professors at CSUN would definitely take his class again. ,awesome
319641,Actually cares about students and willing to go the extra mile.,awesome
319641,A great professor. knowledgable. Would definitely take him again.,good
319641,I really enjoyed his class and would definitely recommend him!,awesome
319641,"SO HARD. Yeah he tells you 1/2 questions on test, but so many people still failed. When reviewing test q's, he had trouble with knowing the answers. Maybe 15 EC pts., on about 2 exams (bc drops worst) at 100 pts. ea. @ 50 questions. Lectures goes off topic, emails ppt., but asks very specific questions. Very little textbook used. Strict on cell use",average
319641,GOOD LUCK because thats exactly what you need to even get a B in that class. My god is he a bad teacher.  You will leave the class learning absolutely nothing and with a lower gpa. Thank you abara.,awful
319641,"Abara is amazing!Yes,can get off topic but knows his stuff and knows it WELL. Some people may think he's mean but you just have to get his personality. Tests are difficult but this is college so I honestly don't know why people complain about it. If you're actually interested in LEARNING take him! He's always willing to clarify what you don't get.",awesome
319641,"he is somewhat funny, but he often gets off topic. the class consisted of 2 midterms and a final. he drops the lowest score and let us use notes on the day of the final because the class average was pretty low. Dont forget to do the 'sona' activities of you wont pass the class. Also, make sure to attend lecture and take thorough notes!",average
319641,He practically tells you what he is going to put on the test and makes sure that you understand the material.  He is very strict on not using your phone in class but this helps you concentrate in class. Class attendance is practically mandatory since he gives surprise extra credit.,awesome
319641,worst teacher in my three years in college. He is very RUDE. I thought he was funny in the beginning too. Until I noticed his jokes consisted calling out students and insulting them. In addition to this his tests questions come from no where. Even if you read the book twice and attend lectures u will do bad on his tests. It horrible. Never again.,awful
319641,"This guy is hilarious! Yes, he would get somewhat distracted, but taught very well. He went over the test materials before the tests, gives lots of extra credit, and drops the lowest test score. Such an easy class and I learned a lot! Recommend him for sure!",awesome
319641,"I watched some of my friends struggle in the class, but it was of how distracted they were with their phones and talking to other people. In order to get an A in the class, you really need to pay attention in his lecture, you dont need the book. Theres only 3 tests, and he drops the lowest score. all the answers are literally from his lecture",good
319641,he is great! very funny! his test are straight forward if you study. everything is based off his notes. he can have his boring moments but it's not a difficult class.,good
319641,He really doesn't care about his students and it shows. Always makes fun of people and talks about himself. To top it off his tests are harder than any test from my upper division courses. I really was looking forward to taking this class and now I am just happy its done with.,awful
319641,"Great prof. He really helps you boost your grades on exams by trying to find ways to give you extra points.Two midterms and final. Makes the final so easy that its impossible not to get an A on the final. Mostly lecture and powerpoint based exams, sometimes hell have it from the book if he hasnt covered the material yet.",awesome
319641,"Abara is very intelligent and truly wants you to learn. This class isnt an easy A, but if you care about your grade and go to the professors office hours now and then you will get an A in the class. Go to every class because he will offer extra credit and take role randomly. Overall great guy and professor. Take notes & pay attention you'll do fine",awesome
319641,terrible professor. Does not teach. Just talks to the class in an inconsistent and unclear manner. Does not take the time to clarify. Goes off topic. Questions on exams are random and hard. I am a straight A student and feel like I will fail his class.  DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!!,awful
319641,Terrible professor. Does not teach. Just talks to the class in an inconsistent and unclear manner. Does not take the time to clarify anything. Goes off topic. Questions on exams are random and hard. I am a straight A student and feel like his class is the only class I will fail. Everyone does bad on his tests. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!!!!,awful
319641,Not recommended! You will always be lost in class. Goes on tangents. Covers barely anything in a longgg class and expects you to go read about it for the exam. Not easy to pass and won't know what your grade is the whole time. It's horrible.,awful
319641,He is horrible at getting through class material and tries to cram everything in one class session before the exam. Exams will have random questions about things never covered. Many people do horrible on the tests. There's no other assignments except the exams. Attending class is important only for random points. Not recommended!,awful
319641,"Best Professor on the whole campus! You will feel confident that you learned the material.  Excellent presentation, thank you for inspiring me in the field of Psychology!",awesome
319641,He is the worst teacher I have ever had. He calls out people to embarrass them and manages to do this every class. I do not know how he is a psychologist. Clearly does not care about anyone. Creates a very hostile environment. Half the class failed his 1st test. Gives e.c. but assigns questions that are hard to answer so no one gets credit.,awful
319641,"Loved him! People just like to hate or be a smart mouth. If you're one of those two, please don't even bother taking his class cause he doesn't put up with peoples crap. He was very helpful and he sincerely loves what he does and wants his students to succeed. And he's hilarious!",good
319641,"I don't understand why his rating is so low. He is an amazing professor. He made class enjoyable and was very knowledgable. He could always answer questions about what your career would require and gave tips as well. 2 papers, not hard at all, and a 20 question final (EASY).",awesome
319641,"He is an amazing professor! He makes lectures interesting and explains the material over if you don't understand. 3 tests, only counts 2. Final is cumulative from the 1st & 2nd exam. Gives some extra credit but does it randomly so you HAVE to attend class. ALWAYS tells you what to know for the exams. Take him!",awesome
319641,Great professor! I really recommend you to take him! The class might be hard but the professor is very helpful! And he makes it easy for you! Just concentrate in class and do not text!! Trust me!,good
319641,Great Professr.,awesome
319641,"Was a bit behind on lessons. I felt overwhelmed towards the end of the semester just because there was new information being thrown at me just days before the final exam.

319641,I love Abara. I took him for 320 and knew i needed him for 321. He helped us with our research which was great and was awesome at giving us the resources we needed. He is supportive and wants his students to do well and it's easy to do so.,awesome
319641,"I'm a pretty dedicated student so to say this guy was a challenge would be accurate. STUDY PAST TESTS. He reuses questions. I got an A by doing so, by reviewing what he taught and DO NOT MISS CLASS. Most of his material is taught in class by lectures. He gives power points out but he fills them in (the answers) during the class by mouth. Just GO.",average
319641,Dr. Abara is one of the best teachers on campus. He is very knowledgeable and he genuinely cares about his students. I highly recommend his class. Not taking his class would be a big mistake!!! Thank you  Dr.Abara for two semesters of excitement and fun!!! You are truly the best. Capish ?,good
319641,"he is arrogant and has anger management issues. He seems nice and funny but soon you realize that he is stalling so as to not teach. If you want to learn, do not take his class. He falls way behind his syllabus, grades unfairly and talks down to students who ask challenging questions.",awful
319641,"Dr. Abara was hilarious!! I felt like I sat through a stand up comedy show every time I attended class. If you put effort into this class, he will put the effort back. I found him to be very fair with his grading. Just do what he tells you and you will be fine! The homework is completely manageable from the lab. I'd recommend him! :]",good
319641,"Dr. Abara is a great professor. He truly does have an interest in the success of his students as long as you follow his simple instructions, which is show up for class and while in class pay attention to lecture. Most importantly do not use your cellphone, which makes sense because YOU are in CLASS! Soooo you can't learn while texting...SIMPLE!!",good
319641,"I had professor Abara for PSY 301 during the Spring 2012 semester. I found him entertaining even though he was hard on attendance, but he was still great! He does come to class late- sometimes 30 minutes late which is a BIG problem! For PSY 301 he assigned 3 papers: your short-term goals, long-term goals, and field of interest.",average
319641,"He is the best teacher!! If you are willing to put in the work and care about your grade, he will be there to help you succeed! He is really funny too! Take good notes and read what he tells you to read--you will do well!",awesome
319641,This professor lost 3 out of 6 of my tests. Luckily I had proof of my tests or else I would have gotten an F. Plus he was such a hassle the whole break and almost the whole next semester to change my grade.,poor
319641,Professor Abara was a great teacher. His class was a good pace and very entertaining and easy to understand.,awesome
319641,Great explanations. Professor is good at explaining and getting the whole class involved. Class was fairly easy just be sure to attend classes and on time.!,good
319641,"Very knowledgeable & entertaining professor. The class does require effort, tests are difficult, but he's generous with test grading. Book was useful as a supplement to his lecture notes, therefore class attendance is crucial. Overall a great professor.",average
319641,"He is funny, but unclear. I had him for 301, a 1-unit class and it felt like a 3-unit class with all the papers that were due. I would not recommend him. Unclear and unreliable.",poor
319641,Abara is the best! He does his best to make the class interesting by being funny and trying to relate to relevant social topics. If you show effort and ask him what you can do to pass the class he will help you out so much. His test are extremely easy if you are attentive during lecture. I would happily take him for Psy 301!,awesome
319641,"Doctor Abara was a great professor,his PSY 250 class was easy if you pay attention &take notes on his lectures. He reviews a lot, which was, it helped me further understand if I didn't get it the first time. He does his best to be understanding, and for that he is awesome. Enjoyed his class a lot and passed with an A without the text.",awesome
319641,Dr. Abara is very passionate about his subject but unreliable.  He walks into the 50 minute class 10 minutes late and isn't clear about what is required of the students.  Class is unorganized and he says he will help but doesn't show up to office hours or do what he says he will.,poor
319641,"Dr. Abara is hilarious. He gives really hard exams...I would say impossible exams...but he lets you bring up your grade a lot!! He does not reply to emails, but is nice in class.",poor
319641,"Dr. Abara is one of the coolest professors i've had at northridge. The class itself wasn't all that interesting, but he made it kinda fun. He's really funny and really does try to do everything to help you pass the class if you ask. He's awesome, i would definitely take another class with him. also, he's a seriously sharp dresser. classy guy.",good
319641,"He is funny but not a very good teacher, the only reason to take him is for a credit/no credit class. Attendance is mandatory..No hw. Very easy class since it is credit/no credit, HATES when people use their cell phones so do not text in there!!!",average
319641,"I LOVE ABARA!!!! He is hilarious and super smart. He is such a cool guy and easy to talk to. If you need anything, he is there. He is clear about what is on the test but the student needs to make sure that they understand the concepts in stats to do well because he challenges his students to evaluate and use critical thinking. You need him! lol",good
319641,I am really upset by all this negativity on Dr. Abara's page. The people hating on him probably didn't even study or come to class. His class is challenging and if you don't abuse his rules then there is no problem. Have some respect! The ones who wrote negative commentary should take an English class because your spelling sucks!,awesome
319641,"If you like learning and having a good time at the same time, take Dr. Abara. He is amazing! He knows his stuff and incorporates humor or easy examples for a better understanding of the material.

319641,"I took Abara for the seminar section of 473 in the summer, not the lecture part. He's really funny, and tries to be engaging. We have a research paper but since it was the summer, he gave us all the data and the methods. We just really needed to find references. 10% is also showing up, but you get to dissect brains which is fun.",good
319641,One of the best out there!,awesome
319641,He is the worst Professor EVER. Super unfair and careless. I took two classes with him cuz didnt have any option and learned absolutely nothing. Do not waist you time!!,awful
319641,Dr. Abara is simply AMAZING!!! His class is informative and he definitely does not bore you. He is super funny and very intelligent. Previous to taking 473 I had second thoughts about taking him by looking at his reviews on rate my professor but I am so glad that I did not listen and it was a pleasure being one of his students. It is a 400 level cl,awesome

319641,I loved his class! He was so funny and notes really helped for the test he gave which anyone can pass if they study the book and notes he gave in class. Also made sure you got your experiment credits done. Was a great help!,awesome
319641,"Great class, it was a Friday class but well worth it. We did group test, there are 6 test but are only 20 questions each and he drops your lowest grade. He is very  funny and makes the class interesting.",good
319641,Great Pofessor. This was a friday class but still very enjoyable. He told lots of jokes. we took goup tests and had a take home test. The final was all questions from previous test. He is an awesome profesor and I would highly reccommend taking him!!,awesome

319641,"he compares his job to customer service, , BUT, the class is really self service!you need to kills your self to learn. talks about difficult concepts of pharmacology A lot of medication names that you cannot even remember.like you say to 10 years old child: we have short term memory and long term memory .tests very hard. great risk if you take him!",average
319641,"You either really ignore the risk you are facing by being in his class, or really don't care about the situation. Biology must not be taught like sociology that you just write down and memorize.the materials are not presented in a conceptual way.",awful
319641,"Very detailed on every aspect that he teaches. Tests will definitely test you. Fun class, makes it interesting. 3 tests, Group test for number 2. Must take notes to pass class material is not usually in the book. Ask him if you can help in his research. Everything on test was covered in lecture and he is very clear about that.",awesome

319641,"Never never take his classes evenif the time matches your schedual! Go to evening classes, but Do NOT TAKE IT!",average
319641,Very fun teacher. The test follow his lectures and the book and have very few surprises. If you take good notes and spend a some time studying the class is pretty easy.

319641,"Dr. Abara is very anal but he means well, honestly after reading these poor reviews on him i was terrified to go to class but he really was not that bad. His accent is thick and hard to understand. He makes reallly corny jokes and thinks that he is so funny and its exhausting! The material was difficult for me and his tests were extremely hard!",poor
319641,"Alright this is how it is with this man..he is brilliant and incredibly knowledgable. He will not waste his time on students who are at high school level. If you wish to learn/move on to grad school take him. Not for those skating by to buy a degree. Hello work for it people, what a concept. Anyhow he is an asset to CSUN and &quot;Valium&quot; is not needed.",good
319641,He is an anal retentive and passive aggressive queen. He must be a nightmare as a coworker.Take a valume.,poor
319641,"His grading system is good. There is only one problem with this professor. It may sound that he cares about you as a student, but he does not. Just go to class, do the assignment and you will be ok. Just don't have high expectations.",good
319641,one of the worst professors i have ever had. the tests are beyond ridiculous!! they are based on things he never even spoke of. bring him a diet coke and he might like you.,awful

319641,"Awful professor, not professional. Stay away!!!",awful
319641,"Great professor. It was discouraging to study for hours upon hours only to receive a fail on every exam but thankfully he curves them. He is very genuine and I never as if he was rude, just sarcastic - and it was funny and always appropriate! To be honest, the students were the ones that made fools of themselves. Recommend course for hard workers.",awesome

319641,"Psychology 402 is a very difficult course. You have to attend every class and you must read the textbook in order to do very well in this class. He is a funny professor and makes you laugh once in awhile but honestly his teaching skills are not so good. In my opinion, when he is teaching he speaks as if you already know the material.",poor
319641,"I do not agree with the negative reviews, I was one of the top students in the class and he was a good professor. Very funny in class.  Teaches to a high degree of expertise. Deliberately speaks clearly. Some other top students also liked him. Disgusted at the -ve reviews from students who felt ENTITLED to an A, but didn't get it handed to them.",awesome

He is very smart and is not like all the other teachers at csun who lecture out of the book and dont know what they are talking about.  If you want an easy A dont take him, if you want to earn your grade take him. It is a challenging class but you'll learn a lot.",average
319641,"Dr. Abara is excellent if you are prepared to interact on an intelligent and mature level. Seriously. I was intimidated at the start Psy.402 but his quality of teaching and mastery of material made me respect & admire him. He is a very special and gifted educator, attentive caring and approachable. LOVE HIM.",awesome
319641,"Not nice. First day of school he acted like a 2 year old who needed a bottle. He is unprofessional, judgmental and course. I would rather eat my arm than finish the course with him. The material is difficult, so having a good guide is essential.",poor
319641,"He is very hard but you can do well because his tests are curving.I didn't like the presentations because only his favorite students got the chance to do it. Others just got free points and all of their effrots were for nothing. On the other hand, he understands your pressure with your late papers and is flexible if you have a reasonable excuse.",average
319641,"I had him during summer and I learned alot, he teaches really good and would help if you ask him. he is mody but everyone is like that. I do recomend him, make sure to study alot. he would tell you what exactly you need to know for his midterms, doesnt sound good&#63;",good
319641,"1. he does not teach psy 345 as the comment below stated! 2. WORST PROFESSOR THAT I HAVE EVER HAD.

UNLESS YOU TEACH YOURSELF!",awful
319641,"Currently in my 2nd class with Dr. Abara, who is one of the most fair and caring, and accessible professors I have ever met. He is professional and his class is difficult but he breaks it up with a great sense of humor. His disposition is extremely pleasant- whoever found him rude probably didn't have their ringer on silent... or failed.",awesome
319641,"I must agree with the majority of these ratings. He loves to talk about drinking margaritas and his teaching style is not effective, or at least I don't consider reading from a power point very useful. He did make rude comments to more than one student, which I found less than amusing. I got a B but i do not recommend at all.",awful
319641,WORST teacher I have ever had. Unwilling to help. MOODY. Favors the guys in class. He thinks his teaching style is perfect regardless that half the class is failing. Says &quot;I don't know&quot; to questions asked in class at least 3 times a day. DO NOT TAKE HIM!!!,awful
319641,"one of the best professors in csun. if you took him and find yourself complaining, if you took him and are blaming him, then you dont know how to apply meta cognition while readin the textbook. immature kids.",awesome
319641,"I don't know why everyone's saying he's hard. I never took notes, hardly ever went to class and never studied; however, I did read the text book. Cause of the super curve he uses a D will turn into a high A on his curve. Nice guy, kind of funny, but not very responsable towards his students. Fairly clear though, easy class, good teacher.",good
319641,"Amazing that the last person said that Dr. Abara is rated to harshly.Yet they did'nt seem to leave high marks either-hmm&#63;Dr Abara plays favorites, is funny at times, until he insults you in a mocking way.Making him unprofessional!He curves grades as to not draw attent to himself for failing every student.Passing with an A is do-able after curving.",awful
319641,People complain all the time that this Professor is so hard. I think the most pivotal thing is to study on your own as well as in groups and make sure to read the book thoroughly. I got an A for both this class and lab. It's not that difficult,average
319641,"stay away from this professor, he is very rude,He has no respect for his students, he doesn't know how to teach. I have no idea how get hired at CSUN. around five people in my class decided to file a complaint against him. if anyone else wants to file a Complain against him, they can go to the office and file the form.",awful
319641,"First off as is said WAY to hard midterms, by any standard. Spends half of class droning about drinking Worst thing is that your grade seems to be dependent on how he is feeling at the time.

319641,Dr. Abara is an immature and rude professor. &quot;Etiquette of Teaching-101&quot; is what he needs to study! He needs to go back to research and leave teaching to those more qualified. He embarrassed me in class for speaking my honest opinion about why a test mean was 30/50. He'll do it to you! Stay away!,poor
319641,"nice sweet guy, 3 hard mid-term. But this is the best teacher for this class if you plan to move on to 402. study and you should pass the class. go to his office hours. he likes to help. he is very funny",average

HAS A STUDY SESSION THE FRIDAY BEFORE THE TEST AND HE GOES OVER EVERYTHING AND HE ANSWERS ALL OF YOUR QUESTIONS.,average
319641,"any professor that has to add 20 points to everyones score in order for them to pass his exams is either 1) not presenting his material in an intelligible way so that students understand him or 2) his tests are not reflective of what he &quot;has&quot; taught.  Either way, this does not reflect favorably on his abilities as a professor.",average

319641,"omg i find him so amusing. he has a very odd and whimsical manner thats really hard to describe. as far as his class, just write down everything he says, pay attention to what he specifically points out as important, and memorize the slides. he obviously loves his subject. and notice how often he says &quot;it's aMAZing&quot;.",awesome

319641,Psy 350 is a very challenging course but if you take it with Professor Abara this class will be easy. He makes things easier to understand but definetly recommend to read the chapters to have a better understanding and you will score high on his exams. The final is optional. Great professor.,awesome
319641,This professor needs to be fired,poor
319641,"If you are an A student, you will meet your greatest challenge in his class. Although he seems very generous on the exams, but that's only part of the story. 6 quizes & 5 questions on each, 30% weigh on final grade.

319641,"Nice man, but bad teacher. Unorganized. When he speaks, his words are very unclear and don't make sense in his context. His tests have tons of errors throughout and practically need interpreting before answering them.

319641,"I am in his class now, I have a test tomorrow and I don't know what the heck is going to be on the test.  He constantly goes of into tangents. He gives you a useless handouts. Basically he is very very very unclear of what he wants from you. I wich I could drop",poor
319641,"Took his class many times. I, too, do not understand the bad ratings. Bottom line: He is very entertaining, funny, his tests are not easy but just study the text and NOT powerpoint or handouts and you will do well. Dont kid yourself, he curves very generously.",awesome

319641,The only positive thing I can say about him is that he's funny. His 250 class feels like an upper graduate studies class. He lectures everyday on the board until the test. The test doesn't even correspond to his lectures!!! I studied so hard for the first test and got a low C. He curved like 21 points because he realized some questions were not rea,average
319641,"He is one of the most intelligent professors I've had at CSUN. Great professor!! 
   Tests are straight from powerpoint, must read the text. He only takes three test and drops the lowest score. Super smart guy, knows so much about psych info. Really loved this class!",awesome
319641,"Ok professor. He loses his train of thought often. Can't keep up with his own syllabus. Gets side-tracked durning lecutre, then rushes as the end. Tries grade fair on the tests, he curves.

319641,"I agree with most of the people that he say he is not very clear or organized. However, he is very generous when he grades his tests.

Never gives enough time to copy notes, not concerned over students, always wanting to leave class. would lecture on tardiness and himself was tardy on many occasions, i still failed all midterms and received C, all depends if you try to make an effort to get to talk to him before he rushes out of class",poor

319641,This professor is really nice. He explains subjects very clearly and thoroughly. I like how he tells us which pages from the book to study for each midterm. He also tells students that these pages contain the answers to the questions on the midterms.,good

Do not slack off! Take home midterm, so if you don't do well then it is your fault. Final is super easy, she basically gives you the answers.",good

304408,She is an amazing teacher. The only reason you will not pass the class is because you don't do the homework. Really fun teacher and I would recommend her but be prepared to work. She does not mess around with laziness. 10 2-3 essays on the weekly readings where some are interesting. Take home midterm. And final which she pretty gives the answers to,awesome
304408,"This 200 class has way more work than my other 400 classes. I expected a lot of reading for a history class, but this class is hard work. On an easy week expect about 4 different reading materials/videos each week, but there can be as much as 10 reading materials. I seriously would not recommend this class or the teacher.",awful

304408,"This course was a tl;dr of a Black Lives Matter protest. Mostly a summation of how every minority was oppressed by the whites. It was both hilarious and painfully dull to write about. By week 2, you'll have written White privilege at least 45 times. You pretty much get full points for writing BS like that and slapping quotes on them. Have fun.",awful
304408,Sandoval should understand that she is teaching a General Education ONLINE course. Her course outline isn't ridiculous but incredibly tedious and pointless. The level of commitment she requires actually insinuates that students have spent their waking hours thinking about the impact of irrelevant Latin civilizations. ,awful
304408,"She is one of the rudest professors I have ever had. Misunderstand a prompt and all of a sudden she's talking down to you accusing you of not reading a prompt. I'm sorry but I was truly excited for the class, but she ruined it for me. Also, giving projects where we have to run around LA to visit places?No, thanks! College students don't have time !",poor
304408,"I've only had her for her OL course. Sandoval is not hard, she's just extremely rigid. Her guidelines and criteria dictates that you should follow her style of writing to a tee. If not, prepare to pay for it. It doesn't matter how well you write, only by how well you mimic her writing style. Take her if you like to write like sheep.",average
304408,worst teacher ive ever had,awful

Assigns WAY too many assignments (all writing) in weekly periods. 2 400word discussion posts tuesthurs, a 3page essay due friday, & quiz on sunday  same schedule each week. Also assigns way too much reading for a simple GE subject. Save yourselves.",average
304408,"Absolutely the worst professor that I've ever had! She is way too strict and very rude towards students. She requires too much for an intro class. If you decide to take her, know that she gives absolutely no partial credit, one 10 point extra credit, LOTS of reading and writing every week. Just do yourself a favor and don't take her.  ",average
304408,This is a very interesting and enlightening course but she can be very unappealing and rude at times. Though she means well her way of addressing students is very negative. Weekly essays are essential to pass but she is a tough grader and expects a lot for a 100 class. If this is not your major stay clear and look for someone else.,good
304408,"Yes, this professor is helpful and does give you much help towards your final and midterm. However, there are weekly essays assigned every week with articles that need to be reads upwards to 20 pages. Which i believe is a lot of work. Definitely tough grader. Large amounts of reading, notes, lectures, videos, and to be honest a lot of rudeness.",poor
304408,I see so many bad comments of Professor Sandoval but I thought she was great! She makes you work for your grade & is dedicated to her beliefs & what she teaches. This class can change your perspective & way of thinking. She does give out weekly journals on the readings but they're only 1 and a half-2 pages. Jst do the readings & you'll pass!,good
304408,"I took her class last summer and she makes the class very easy if you actually try. The tests are exactly what she asks for in the study guide. She gave many extra credit opportunities. My final grade was 3 points away from a perfect score thanks to all of the extra credit. she requires weekly posts, no big deal. Would definitely take her again!",awesome
304408,Interesting class although more work than expected. Very clear from the very beginning of class about what's expected so double check syllabus before asking a question on the assignments. Always take notes very important for her midtem and final!!! Challenging class and you can definitely pass but no slacking off.,good
304408,"Dr. Sandoval is one of the best professors in the Chicanao Studies department. Not only it is a 100 class. She makes you work for a high grade in her class and assignments. Her lectures are very interesting, especially about her work in Low Rider culture and the Chicanao culture as well. Talk to her in her office hours, your grade will thank you!",good

304408,By far the MOST WORK I've ever had to do for one class. 15k+ words written for the semester. A discussion every week plus essays and semester length research project. She provides NO feedback for written work either. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS TEACHER,poor
304408,HARDEST GRADER THERE IS!  Gives SO much homework! One essay per week. Quizzes that no one could pass since she grades so tough! Your essay will never be good enough for her even if you follow all the directions. I HATE THIS CLASS SO MUCH! It is the only class I'm stressing in. Save yourselves from a headache and just don't take this class. Unless you love a challenging grader and love extra work. Good luck! You'll need it!,good
304408,This prof. made my semester hell. She contradicts much of what she says & is very judgmental when it comes to essays (which there are ALOT of). This is expected from a college prof. except her grammatical and spelling errors are way too frequent so I wouldn't trust her judgement. I learned a lot but had to teach myself. Passed but I don't recommend,awful

Please I am warning you now do not take her. you will regret it.,awful

She's not a professor for students to slack off, she makes you work but then again there are worser profs.",good
304408,Please with all my heart i beg you not to take her. It is not a challenge its just so much work and so little time and she swears her class is our world. I don't think you should take her unless you are a CHS major..even then enter if you dare!,awful

304408,DON'T TAKE HER!!! she only likes it her way and isn't here for the interest of the students! she doesn't help you with your questions on assignments. I always do my assignments but i regret taking her.,poor
304408,"Class is boring, can't ask her a question unless you want to feel stupid. I was the one of the 4 Asians in the class, therefore I had lots of questions but I ended up asking it during her hours. Final project, presentation about your family life. Power point; 4-5 slides, MUST cover everything in 10 minutes. Students & prof will rate you.",good
304408,"First Off, do not take her!! She teaches her basic level classes like her upper division courses. she does not help and if you ask a question she makes you feel like you are a foolish child. This is one of the few professors that i will never forget and for all the wrong reasons. She lets her politics and emotions for the subject dictate the class.",poor
304408,"one word: unapproachable. The course requirements were clearly laid out the first day -no surprises. You must make the commitment to actually read ALL the material and prepare for in class quizzes otherwise, you WILL fail.

304408,absolutely the best professor for CHS or any class really. She is a great person as well as professor. For those who rated her harshly on the online class it's because she had never given an online class before! STILL AMAZING PROFESSOR! CLEAR AND INTELLIGENT DO TAKE HER CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!,awesome
304408,"Do not take this professor, there is something really wrong with her. I took her for an online class, I had to do 4 major essays, 4 really unclear exams, a 10 page research assignment that requires a visit to her assigned museums, discussion posts every week, 4-5 articles and 2-3 chapters of reading.",poor
304408,Honestly the worst teacher I have had at CSUN. She is ridiculous and she can't even use proper grammar. She is so unhelpful when asked about ANYTHING. I definitely feel like I would have learned more and been less resentful about the subject matter if I had read the book alone without her idiotic and unintelligent lectures. DO NOT TAKE!,awful
304408,HARD!,awesome
304408,"I hate this teacher. Seriously, her expectations are unrealistic she gives way too many pages to read in one night. She can't answer simple questions. In my opinion she is a very angry person inside and takes it out on her students. She makes me want to cry everyday and quit school, never have I been so uninspired to quit school. She's terrible.",poor
304408,This teacher demands that you devote 3-5 hours a day only to her work.  She has unreal expectations in what she expects you to read daily and provides no feedback as to why your grade is the way it is.  DO NOT TAKE THIS WOMAN unless you have large amounts of free time and are willing to devote it completely to this class. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!,awful
304408,Really an amazing teacher. She might seem a little bit strict but her teaching methods are very good and her personality brings the class to life.,awesome
304408,She is a very smart teacher and does not allow anyone to slack off. You use a reader instead of a book that costs about $40 outside of school in some store. She's a devout feminist and its very interesting to hear her lectures. But she's funny at times and always speaks with a smile on. She welcomes questions but it is at times intimidating.Ok prof,good
304408,By the end of the semester she earned all my respect. She is dope!! She definitely knows her stuff and if you're smart you will pick up on that knowledge. Those who say she is hard must be really stupid and I know this because I had many of you idiots in my class. She is clear about her expectations and standards.,awesome

304408,DO NOT TAKE!!! She is a very knowledgeable professor but her attitude is terrible. I?ve never had such a rude prof in my 4 years of college.

She needs an attitude adjustment thats for sure. She's a ,average

I don't think she tolerates kiddish behavior.AN,awesome

Be tolerant and understand that she's in a process like all of us are. Be nice.",average

Bottom line, take this class if you're willing to study HARD!",awesome

109193,So enthusiastic about the subject really gets the class's attention. Always making jokes I laughed at least once every lecture. At times can lecture too quickly but will go over the material again if some people are still not getting it. Makes topics relatable and is always willing to answer questions. Would love to take this class again! 4 exams,awesome

109193,He's super funny! and really cool. But attendance is mandatory and his tests are tough. You must read the chapters in order to pass his 4 tests because the lectures are not enough. There is a Jeopardy game that is no longer EC but mandatory for points. those are your only chances for points which makes the class hard cause you MUST do well on exams,average

109193,Gardner is very enthusiastic! He really does make learning psychology fun and the videos that we watch are very helpful. But reading the book is crucial to passing the class. His tests are easy if you take good notes and read the book. He gives  you assigned readings so that's helpful/ His tests are so weird and tricky so you need to know the stuff,average
109193,"Professor Gardner is incredibly enthusiastic during his lectures making it easy to stay focused. He also has a great way of breaking down the concepts taught, making it easier to understand. His exams are fairly easy, whatever is mentioned in class is most likely to be seen on the exam along w/ some stuff from the readings! He's a great guy!",awesome
109193,"Gardner is amazing, there's no other way to put it. He's hilarious, kind, entertaining, knowledgeable, and really understands his students. Best professor I've ever had! We only had 4 exams /semester and no final. I always looked forward to being in class, I knew I was going to have a great time laughing and learning fascinating concepts. Take him!",awesome
109193,"He is probably one of the best professors I have ever had so far. He mixes humor and learning, which makes the info a little bit easier to digest and remember. He doesn't do a final, which is nice. His tests are okay and straightforward as long as you at least try to learn the lesson.",awesome
109193,His class is one of the best I've taken! There is no homework although he does tells you which pages to read from the textbook to learn more about his lecture. Tests are easier than expected and his lectures are really fun!,awesome

And plus you will learn a lot in his class! No homework, just 4 tests. But you still have to study. But he always tells u wat to read and sections will be in the test! Highly recommend",awesome
109193,BEST PSYCH TEACHER EVER! You must take his class! It's super easy and he never assigns homework! It also means you really gotta study and at least skim through the assigned chapters.,awesome
109193,"Awesome psych teacher, he is really passionate about what he teaches. He loves to get his students involved in class examples. Sometimes he can go a little off topic. Only readings and exams in this class so be ready to read! Love him and would take him again.",awesome
109193,"He made time for you during office hours and made concepts clear. He gives good examples, but tests can be confusing  because of the way he words it. His lectures are funny, but the power point information is dull. I personally would not take his class again. ",average
109193,He is one of the worst teachers i have ever taken..... his test are confusing and his lectures are dull. He's one of those professors that doesn't care about his students as well.,awful
109193,"Prof. Gardner is hilarious and a genius. He keeps the class awake and entertained. Though, his lectures are pretty confusing and we hardly took notes in class. He usually just assigns us readings from the book, and tells us to take notes based on the reading.  The tests are difficult and tricky, but if you go to his office hours he will help you. ",average
109193,"Professor Gardner is hilarious! Make sure to take notes and use that as study guide, because it will be on the tests. There are only four tests, and you have to be present all the time. If you're late twice, that would count as one absence and he will deduct points for every absence. Then, there's a jeopardy game that really helps your grade!",awesome
109193,"Prof. Gardner is the best!! 4 exams. No homework. Just read ahead, skim and pace yourselves throughout so you fully understand his lessons. His powerpoint is your psych study guide for exams. Not much scribbling; just remember the concepts & terms. He's a genius. So take him when you can! Bonus: funny funny guy and amazing and interesting lectures!",awesome
109193,"This class is not ordinary. He has 4 tests total which count for your whole grade. Attendance is MANDATORY. He makes you sign in at the beginning and gives you extra points at the end of the semester if your attendance is great, trust, you will need those points. Get ready to read the book because there is really no lecture and no notes in class. ",average
109193,"Prof. Gardner is very fun and entertaining. His lectures are a little confusing, but if you read the book you should be fine. He sometimes provides study guides or outlines, but DO NOT go based on what is on there because sometimes the test is nothing like it. It is really hard to get a C or higher on his test. Best of Luck! ",average
109193,"Gardner is a great professor, he is entertaining and shows passion on the subject. Though the test are pretty difficult. You really have to read the books in order to pass the tests. There are 4 midterms, no final. I would recommend him for psych 150, but for psych 250 i think another professor would be best. ",good
109193,"Love this teacher, he's the funniest teacher I ever had. No homework or quizzes, only 4 tests and psychology experiments (which are easy). The tests are somewhat difficult, but if you attend every class you'll do fine since he doesn't test on anything he hasn't talked about in class. It's a lot of reading. You'll enjoy his lectures though!",good
109193,"he is a great person, hilarious and entertaining. but it is a tough class. he gets on you if you begin taking notes and tells you to just listen to him not write but you will do horribly on the tests like that. TAKE NOTES. at least try. he lectures at a very fast pace so try your best to scribble notes. tests can be tough. only 4 tests",average
109193,I would suggest this professor to everyone around because he makes it specific as to what you need to study to pass and disregards other information.  He's funny which makes the lecture much more enjoyable and uses examples that we could relate too.  To get an A you have to work for it but it's doable.  If you have the chance take this professor,good
109193,"I passed this class with a C only because I studied  like three days before each test. I suggest you take notes during lecture but write short phrases,  he lectures at a fast paste. Skim through the book before lectures and read thoroughly after but make sure it connects to the lectures or you'll read extra unimportant stuff.  ",good
109193,"He was such a hilarious professor and made the topics connect with real life. There was 4 tests, no final, and you have to participate in experiments to pass the class or do the essay. Overall, great class! ",good
109193,"This guy is all over the place. Tells us not to take any notes and does not provide study guides. When it comes to the exams, nothing seems relevant. More than half of the class gets a C or less on every exam. This is the first time I take a professor who is careless and my GPA dropped because of it. AVOID HIM IF YOU CAN!",awful
109193,"Gardner is a funny guy. Mostly lectures and once in awhile plays videos. Pay attention to everything he says because it WILL be on the test. Just take notes in class and go over it in the textbook later and you'll be fine but also skim through the other chapters. 4  exams 40 or less questions, no final, allows one make up exam and a day of jeopardy",good
109193,"Not allowed to take notes you are only suppose to listen to his lectures but they are all over the place. He is not concrete at all he says one thing and then says something completely different the next day. Mostly shows videos in class, only 4 exams and they hard because he does not specify what is going to be on so you are on your own. The Worst",awful
109193,"I took Dr. G for Psych 250 & passed. I'd advise the students to not let his fun lectures distract them from reading along in the book for those lectures. Many students who struggled on tests, which are tough, were struggling because they were not reading the book. He's full of energy, loves his job, and will help you with specifics in Office Hours.",good
109193,"book NOT required for class. grade is based on FOUR tests. no final. attendance is extra credit. usually talks (occasionally writes things down) the whole class. also shows lots of videos. since he talks the whole class, make sure you're paying attention to key points he mentions in class. reading the book helps A LOT.",average
109193,"TAKE HIM! Loves his subject, tests are ONLY OFF OF LECTURES. Book is just a guideline. 4 tests, NO FINAL, NO HOMEWORK. Attendance is important, if you miss less than 2 classes, you get extra points. Took 8am and he really wakes you up. Encourages questions, tests are easy, DEFINITELY not boring, makes class fun! Definitely would take him again.",awesome
109193,"Love this teacher! His class is on opposite side of campus from my dorm and its at 8am, but his lectures makes me want to go to class. Class laughing every class. He is very passionate about psychology and he's a pretty laidback teacher. Attendance is mandatory if you want to pass this class since tests are based on his lectures. Love his class!",awesome
109193,"He definitely woke me up every morning at 8. He's so cool and makes the lectures not boring. The tests aren't hard but they are weird & you have to listen well in lectures & probably skim the book.Only 4 tests, no real final or homework. Take him!",good
109193,"Gardner is one of the best Psych professors you will encounter. He is not only goofy but his funny stories make you understand the material much better and it actually sticks in your head. His tests are very fair. READ THE BOOK in advance. He gives out four tests, NO FINAL. I found his class to be very easy but you have to study!!",awesome
109193,"Gardner was awesome, He clearly loves what he is doing. Gives lots of examples, write those down, they will help you remember. His tests are not like any other professor, they're actually kind of silly, If you study you'll do great. He tends to go off on tangents during his lectures, it can get confusing, but don't hesitate to ask questions.",awesome
109193,Fun class! Very energetic professor. Just review your notes before tests and you should be fine!,average
109193,He is really hard and confusing. He changes topics a lot. Made me hate the class.,poor
109193,"Prof. Gardner is the best psy professor! He's full of energy and makes the class entertaining. He makes the material easier than it is. He encourages asking questions, please ask if something isn't clear. There are 4 tests and no final! Attend his classes and read the book! and that will help you get a good grade. Take him!!!",awesome
109193,"He's a great teacher, easy class if you pay attention and do the readings, you wont be bored. He's really funny.",awesome
109193,"Mike is awesome. He's really funny and tries to keep the class engaged at all times. Always responds to questions, he encourages them. His tests are easy as long as you go to class. Don't even think twice about it, take him for whatever class.",awesome
109193,He did a great job of keeping us entertained. He tends to 'act out' all his lectures. You will feel like you're watching a play or something lol (I dont know how he always has the energy for it). But you will not be bored. Take him if you can.,awesome
109193,"He is a great professor. The only reason why I didn't give him a 5/5 is that he's not the all-around perfect professor. His tests are easy if you pay attention in class/take notes. Grades on a curve, so your grades are probably going to end up better than they actually are. He keeps the class fun and interesting. Downside: his classes are large.",good
109193,"take him. third sem here @ csun and he'ss the best professor i've had. Clear, hilarious an keeps you in tact the entire class.",awesome
109193,"HILARIOUS! I LOVE HIM EVEN THOUGH I DIDNT GET A GOOD GRADE BUT WHATEVER, I EXTREMELY RECOMMEND!",awesome
109193,"HE IS LITERALLY THE BEST PSYCH TEACHER EVER! IF YOU GET HIM YOU WILL LOVE HIM! PRETTY EASY, HE IS EXTREMELY FUNNY AND HE GIVES EXAMPLES THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND AND YOU WILL LOOK FORWARD TO GOING TO HIS CLASS. ALL YOU NEED ARE YOUR NOTES AND HIS TESTS ARE BASICALLY NOTES AND NO DEFINITIONS AT ALL! PIECE OF CAKE! :D",awesome
109193,Gardner is awesome.  If he were my professor for every class I would not complain!,awesome
109193,Hands down the best professor I've had at csun. If you're looking for an easy GE you've found it. Attendance is mandatory but his lectures are never boring. Don't waste your money on the book. I never opened mine and I got 100's on every test. Take detailed notes on his lectures and review them before the tests. Warning: he sweats a lot.,awesome
109193,"Prof. Gardner was the funniest / coolest tacher I have ever had at CSUN. Going to class was like watching a comedian and I always looked forward to his class. YOU MUST STUDY FROM THE BOOK otherwise you will probably get only C's on the tests, which are easy if you read the chapters. Highly recommend this teacher.",average
109193,"An overall great Professor, but the test were confusing for me. I followed the lectures and book, but the style of the test(s) weren't my cup of tea. Don't bother reading the book like myself. The tests are based on the lectures, and if you see an answer on the test from the book or lectures go with from the lecture notes. I made that mistake.",average
109193,"All lectures and tests. 4 tests and a jeopardy game. No extra credit! He's funny don't get me wrong but not so helpful if you go to his office hours. If you are not a good guesser or test taker, DO NOT take his class! You MUST read your book and take notes in class to what he says. Write down his examples too!",awesome
109193,Best Professor I've had at CSUN. As long as you go to class you should do fine in his class. He's really funny and makes the class interesting at 8 am,awesome
109193,IT IS PRIMARILY LECTURES AND TEST NO EXTRA CREDIT GIVEN. SO IF YOUR NOT A TEST TAKER DONT GO. GOING TO HIS OFFICE HOURS WILL NOT DO ANY JUSTICE HE DEFIANTLY DOESN'T WORK WITH YOU IF YOUR A STRUGGLE TEST TAKER. HIS TEST ARE DESIGNED TO BE FUNNY BUT ARE IRRITATING,good
109193,"The most interesting professor, you will definitely not be bored in his class. He makes the subject easy to understand. It was a fun class. And the test are all multiple choice. That's a bonus. ;)",good
109193,"The most energetic, hillarious professor you'll ever meet. Had him 8am M/W, which would normally be awful, but I looked forward to his class every week!Great guy, answers emails back quickly, and you get your test grades the same day! Couldn't imagine taking Psych with anyone else...I learned SO much! Highly recommend!",awesome
109193,"I absolutely LOVED this guy. I'm almost certain he has ADHD but his teaching style is awesome. He doesn't hand out lame papers to write either. Show up to class, take good notes while being entertained at the same time, and then Ace  his tests. A helpful hint: write down the examples he gives and study those. Gardner's the MAN!",awesome
109193,"AMAZING. ENTERTAINING. Going to class is like going to a comedy show. Bring your coffee, sit back, and prepare to be entertained while learning! Silly jokes, stories, and all relevant to the topic. He is so passionate about what he does. Just great. Easy, only a few tests, noncumulative.",awesome
109193,I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR!!! He is the greatest! His class is easy if you pay attention and go over the book. Attendence is mandatory but he makes his class fun and interesting. He is really funny and he knows the subject well. Definetly recomend taking him if you can,awesome
109193,"I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR! I'm taking his biopsych class, and even though the material is a lot to take in, he is a super friendly, upbeat dude. He definitely makes class interesting and I actually look forward to going for once.",awesome
109193,Extremely funny guy esp. for an 8 am class on M/W.  5 exams.  I liked the subject but I felt his exams were extremely difficult no matter how hard I studied. Got the same grade on each exam. Exams based off examples and not definitions. It's a fun but really demanding class that requires you to put so much study time in to prepare for the exams.,good
109193,"I love Mike Gardner! The 1st and last test are the most difficult ones. There's no final and the 2nd and 3rd tests are not too bad. Read the book and take good notes in class. He always says 'use your notes as a guideline' so whatever he mentions in class, make sure you read about it in the book. It's challenging, but office hours helps a lot.",good
109193,"My favorite teacher by far this semester! Very funny, intelligent man. I took his 8 am class thinking I would be struggling to stay awake, however Gardner does an excellent job of keeping students awake and involved in his lectures. Explains material thoroughly, shows cool videos in class, cracks funny jokes, and keeps you on your toes!",awesome
109193,Amazing professor so energetic and funny! but it does require tons of studying and reading to pass! I loved the class! I didn't pass but that was my fault for the low effort I portrayed in his class. so if you are ready for a challenge go for him he is great overall,awesome
109193,Mike was fantastic.  Really made the material easy to learn and very clear.  Attendance is very necessary because he bases the tests mostly on what he talks about in class.,awesome
109193,"Gardner is the best! Challenging class but it was my favorite last semester. The four tests are taken from everything he says in class so you have to go. No matter what-be in class. No final, that's nice! He's hilarious and has a lot of energy. I would love to take him again if I could.",good
109193,HE is a very interesting professor and he is very funny. Buy the book it is your bible read every section he tells you to read and go to class everyday to uerstand what the book is talking about better.,average
109193,"He is full of energy, which was really weird for an 8 am class. This class is not extremely difficult, but if you dont put effort in, you will not pass. 4 tests in total, plus a bunch of points for showing up and playing jeapordy. He tries to make everything is understood by everyone. Overall the most energetic professor i have ever had.",awesome
109193,"Mike is the best!! I wasn't looking forward to waking up early for a 8am class, but after the first day I didn't mind at all! His lectures are full of energy & he tries to make everything understandable. When others say he sweats, they aren't lying. He sweats A LOT and he tells you that the first day. Read the book & attend class-you'll do fine.",good
109193,He is really funny and interesting teacher. I failed but that was because I didn't read ahead nor did I study for tests. There are 4 test in total and no final.,average
109193,"Absolutely fantastic and interesting teacher.  I can't say I did too well on the tests, but that's definitely because I didn't read the book, and the tests aren't what make the class good - it's absolutely fantastic if you're thinking about psychology but aren't quite sure yet.  Basically, if you're going for entry level psych, Mike all the way.",awesome
109193,just an awsome prof. and gets his point across with some jokes,awesome
109193,"I dont know what these people are talking about. Gardner is the best professor ever. Yes, he sweats but he is the BEST professor at CSUN. He makes you want to learn about the subject and makes calss anything but boring. If i could have him for every class I would. AMAZING PROFESSOR!",awesome
109193,"Gardner is one animated professor, he sweats like a dog and jumps all over the place. Attendance is mandatory but youll want to go because he is entertaining. however, attending the lectures does not help whatsoever with the tests, the textbook will save you, READ IT, LOVE IT.",awful
109193,"Very entertaining! His lectures are very interesting and he makes them understandable by relating them to things that apply to you. His tests can be a bit difficult, but if you show up to class and read the text it's easy. You even get 12 points for attendance. Also, no final for this class which is amazing ! Highly recommended !",awesome
109193,He is really passionate about teaching BUT its impossible to get an A in this class. I had a 4.0 GPA but i got a C in the class after hours and hours of studying. His tests are really difficult.,average
109193,The textbook is your best friend! Make sure you buy it and read it!!!,average
109193,"Very energetic, he wont bore you thats for sure! The subject was interesting if you like neuroscience, I loved his class and I learned soooo much from it, but his exams are definitely difficult, take notes even if he says dont take notes and make sure to read every chapter in the book!",average
109193,"Really good lectures. He teaches you a lot without really trying to &quot;teach&quot; in the traditional way. He wants you to understand concepts, not memorize a bunch of junk you'll forget and never use. Always an interesting and fun class. He's full of energy and gives a lot or real world examples to illustrate his points. One of the best!",awesome
109193,"I have chosen Gardner for 3 PSY courses because he keeps the whole class interested in the subject, he makes psychology FUN and he doesn't mind repeating himself or giving alternate examples that apply to the modern world. EXCELLENT PROFESSOR. He is definitely one of my favorites, and he will always keep you awake in class with his sense of humor.",awesome
109193,"Gardner is God! Honestly one of the best psychology professors at CSUN. He is so much fun and even if you take him early in the morning you will have no problem waking up with all of his energy. The class material may seem difficult, but as long as you go to every class and READ THE BOOK. You'll get A's on every test like I did. RECOMMEND!",awesome
109193,"Gardener ALWAYS has so much energy! He is a really good teacher, and always uses good examples to connect the concepts to our every day life. He doesn't believe in definitions, only learning concepts, so you don't have to memorize definitions. The class is really interesting and it never feels like 3hrs and 25 mins!",awesome
109193,"Gardner is a riot! He will always always ALWAYS make you laugh and keep you interested in the subject. He is very happy to be a professor and has a really good attitude every class session! Make sure you read and go to class and you will be fine! However, if you do not go to class then he will take points off of your grade so be careful!",good
109193,"Great professor and brilliant man. He talks super fast, no one has time to take notes, it takes a few classes to get used to. Browse the textbook on sections he suggests but mostly attend class and pay attention. I don't have a taste for bio so this was one of the hardest psych classes I've taken",good
109193,"Gardner is brilliant!! Sure, he's crazy and fast talking, but a genius nonetheless. I took him for 250 and again for 352. He doesn't really like note takers but take them anyway because you'll need them. The exams are pretty difficult so MAKE SURE to read thoroughly. Tests are 35ish q's but he makes them out of like 28 because he knows they're hard",awesome
109193,"I had this prof for psy 150 and it was easy, fun and good. I expected the same for 352 but nope. His lectures barely reflect the tests, sure he goes over the book but his questions are so dumb. Maybe 352 is the class he cant really teach, a lot is learned but tests will kill u.",poor
109193,There are 4 exams in this class.  There is no HW assigned and the class grade is based only on 4 exams.  Attendance is Mandatory & he does take roll.  We must also do 5 Credits of Psychology Experiments.  His exams are difficult & he lectures very fast.  He exams consist of both lecture and textbook.  He's very energetic & a fast talker.,good
109193,"Gardner is one of my favorite teachers for his enthusiasm and his love for teaching. Although, I do have to admit that his tests are difficult if you don't read the book so just sit down and read. Plus he will tell you not to write anything down when he lectures, but do it anyway. You will definitely need the notes.",good
109193,This guy is a comic. I mean a real comic. I enjoyed his comedy but when it came to him teaching I was so frustrated. I mean CSUN?s professors are really slacking. My professors in community college were much better. His lectures are useless and he tells you not to write anything down. His exams consist of 30 questions that don?t make sense. He also,awful
109193,"I went into this class so interested, he was interesting and funny.When it came down to the his testing method, everything that I had studied for wasn't there. They are worded so tricky.

109193,he has lots of energy! his test are easy as long as you pay attention and READ the book on your own time. the only hard part is actually taking time to sit down on your own time and read. it's only one book though. I would recommend him since he isn't a boring professor. he makes his topics fun and interesting.,good
109193,"Gardner is an amazing professor! I never leave class without laughing at least 5 times. He is witty and cheerful, and excited about Psychology! Definitely take him for psyche 150 and 250, just make sure to read the book! because his lectures are pretty much based on the book! YAY!!!!",awesome
109193,He's an interesting professor but his tests are HARD. He talks really fast and is known to go off topic all the time. I had him for Motivation and just got by. Take Elias instead.,poor
109193,"Assumes you already have advanced  knowledge of the brain and all neurological functions.  Tests are impossible at best even after copious notes and hours of study.  Wonderful person, however, disorganization and fast speech confuse students.  Needs to have reliable study guides and reasonable tests.",average

109193,"Amazing Teacher!! Not your basic lectures, Gardner is clearly passionate about Psychology! I had him for Psy 150 and made sure to sign up for his 250 course. Though he is an amazing teacher be sure to read the book because his tests are based off of them. His lectures are only meant to give you an easier, relaxed example of what the book says.Take!",average
109193,"Professor Gardner speaks very fast and uses very basis vocab and language in his lectures. However, his tests are very hard and uses textbook/professional vocabulary and are not reflected from the lectures. Your grade comes from your tests; no research papers or extra credit opportunities. I would not recommend it unless you're a great test taker.",poor
109193,"Professor Gardner is in my opinion, an average professor.  He is very passionate about the subject but frequently loses his train of thought while lecturing and speaks very quickly.  He says not to take notes but without them you are likely to fail all of the tests of which there are four with no final.  Make sure you keep up with your reading!",average
109193,"Funny, interesting, and actually cares about the subject. Be sure to read!",good
109193,"Hard class.  He is all over the map during the lectures.  You will need to use the book to help fill in the gaps because you won't be able to take notes fast enough.  Also, he will say something is not going to be on the test, then it turns up -so study EVERYTHING.  If you have a great memory for details, you will do alright.  Not an easy A.",poor
109193,"Talks way to fast, swear has ADD, jumps topics a lot.  Hard to focus.  Have to basically read book and borrow notes from others.  Can't record his lectures.

109193,"Prof. Gardner is without a doubt the best teacher I've ever had. His classes are amazing, he is hilarious, and his tests are based on his lectures. So, if you go to class you get an easy A. Try to take every class you can with him, you won't regret it!!! He's the best of the best.",awesome

109193,"Even though I passed the class I can't out of experience possible recommend him to anyone else. He's remarkably impossible to comprehend most of the time and will make your brain have pain even though the brain doesn't have pain receptors.  Maybe he's better when it's not a one day class, but if it is, seriously, don't take him. You won't learn.",poor
109193,"I think this guy was rated highly because of the group tests he USED 2 give that would boost ur grade. This is the 1st time n 3yrs. That I can safely say I learned nothing.

109193,"He's a really great professor. He talks really fast though. His tests are conceptual, take a lot of notes and read the chapters!!! Read them more then once. Take the online quizzes because he uses a few questions from there on tests. Overall Gardner is a really funny professor and he's really nice.",good
109193,"Very fast talking professor that is unclear at times. I didn't like this class personally, but it depends on the person. He has 4 tests and doesn't believe in midterms or finals. I would rather take this course online if it was offered at the time.",poor
109193,"If you like energetic, crazy, fast-talking professors then you will love Gardner. I absolutely loved this class. Gardner made me look forward to Monday mornings. There is no final and no midterm because he doesn't believe in cramming for one huge test. I didnt use the book all that much and did Fine. I didnt even need a lot of notes.  RECOMMENDED!",awesome
109193,"Gardner's a very entertaining professor, attendence IS MANDATORY but he keeps your interest.. TAKE NOTES!!!! his tests are ALL from the notes and he talks really really fast so pay attentions..",awesome
109193,"Highly recommend Professor Gardner.  Read the textbook before the lectures if you can, it helps.  He says not to take notes, but I suggest you do--to study for the tests.  Don't fall behind on the required Psych Experiments.",awesome
109193,"funny, crazy, energetic & very entertaining. this class isnt super easy though. there were 4 tests, a game of jeopardy, and no final. he takes attendance. i worked my butt off taking notes from both his lectures and the book. i did well on all the exams except 1. i expected an A and ended up with a B+ kinda disappointing for a overachiever like me",good
109193,YOU MUST ATTEND CLASS!!!! This class is based on notes. You must take good notes in order to pass the exams. This professor can be fun but he is also demanding. Not recommend for those that like to stay home and just read the book.,average
109193,"He's not for everybody, but great for people who attend regularly and listen well.  Gardner is a fun guy, knows his stuff, very energetic, tries to keep it interesting.  I want to take another class with him; I paid attention, and I got an A.  If you skip class regularly, though, you will be screwed on tests.",good
109193,"I recommend taking Gardner. He is entertaining and makes the class fun. The truth is I would not go to class that often but the tests werent that hard. The only reason I would do ok on the test is because I would REMEMBER his lectures (he gives examples to help us understand)and of course theres a paper, its an upper division class (what u expect&#63;)",average
109193,Most amazing professor ever.  Definitely knows his stuff.  He's so funny and class was always interesting. Textbook is absolutely mandatory though and tests were tricky and kind of hard.  But definitely recommend!  You can't not love him!,awesome
109193,"I took him for Psy 150 because he isnt as boring as other professors. He talks extremely fast and is very unorganized with his lectures. You can't possibly take notes, even the interpreters for the deaf had a hard time keeping up. if you study from what you can catch while he lectures and the reading, you can pass for sure. attendance is mandatory",good
109193,"Dr. Gardner is great. Its hard to find a professor nowadays that genuinely has a passion for teaching and cares about his students. His students are a little difficult, but if you attend class and read the book, you'll do fine. I highly recommend Gardner. He's great :)",good
109193,"Dr. G is very dedicated to his job. He is VERY enthusiastic about teaching psychology and really encourages his students to participate in his lectures. You MUST attend class; his notes are vital to the tests. His tests are VERY hard. If you like biology, take him. If not, take someone else.",good
109193,"THE GREATEST PROF EVER! HE IS HILARIOUS! his class is a bit challenging but who doesn't love a good challenge&#63;! you MUST take notes and study them cuz thats where he gets his exam from. if youre a good note-taker than CONGRATS this is the class for you! if youre not a good note-taker, THEN LEARN!",awesome
109193,"Greatest teacher ever! He is absolutely hilarious. Makes the class very fun, interesting, and explains everything really well. Kinda hard to take notes, but as long as you read and understand the material you will do fine. Psychology is already interesting for me, and he just makes me want to suck on the nipple of psychology. you MUST take him!!!!",awesome
109193,So as a psych major everyone told me to take 250 with this guy. according to every other person on csun who has taken 150 he is amazing and hillarious. WRONG! he's not funny but annoying. he's a horrible professor. you can study the book as much as you want but the tests are based on his lecture and you CANNOT take notes with him. DONT TAKE,awful
109193,best class of the day. he is so funny and he explains things perfectly. you remember so much without really having to take notes. he makes the subject really interesting and relateable too.,awesome
109193,One of the greatest professors I've had!,awesome
109193,"The truth must be told. Gardner is an entertaining professor, but that's all. His nice personlaity isn't a good replacement for his unreasonably fast talking habit, his lecturing style that makes note taking almost impossible, his policy on attendance, his disorganize lectures. Good man but has issues when it comes to teaching.",poor
109193,Real fun and interesting professor..makes class fun and is very helpful. class consist of daily lectures and only three exams.. no final..,awesome
109193,BEST PROFESSOR EVER! he is so funny and makes the class great. its the type of class you wouldnt mind waking up early to attend. highly recommended. :),awesome
109193,"HE'S GREAT!!! He is my favorite teacher at CSUN so far. He is really nice and funny. I have never been a straight A student but I got 100% on 3 out of 4 of his tests! The way I did it is by showing up to every class and taking notes, if you do that you're golden! He makes information relevant and interesting",awesome
109193,"A very good teacher. He understands the way most students learn, though this class may be hard if the only thing you know how to do is study a textbook. Tests are based on lecture, not the book. I'd recommend maybe borrowing the txt instead of buying if this is your GE, cuz its more supplemental than anything. Show up, listen and pass. =)",awesome
109193,Showing up for class is mandatory.Hes really funny and his lectures are important when you are there you know what he covered so the day before the test just read the book over and you should be fine. Dont really have to know terms and definitions either. Super easy when you get a hang of his test.,awesome
109193,mike gardner is the BEST professor! i enjoyed his class so much! as long as you pay attention in class and read a bit of the book before the tests you should be fine! its cool cuz you get to take tests in groups! i loved this class! grade is only based on tests and be sure to not be late or absent. i got an A!,awesome
109193,"Gardner is an entertaining professor but very bad at teaching. He talks way too fast which doesn't make it easy to take notes in class. Notes are VERY necessary for tests, which are waaay too hard for the what he teaches.I got a b+ so his class is very do-able...just hard to keep invloved in the class. I wouldn't consider taking him again.",awful
109193,tests are confusing and if you are late 3 times he counts it as one abense if you have more then 3 you marks off points. you'll have a 10 page paper due at the end of the semester,awful
109193,"This was an extremely fun class. Mike is very interactive and really wants you to do well. This is one of those rare classes where you will get there 5 minutes early every time. Its like listening to a comedian for an hour, and then passing the test. The tests are only hard if you haven't gone to lectures.",awesome
109193,"GREAT!! Yes, his test are hard for people who do not come to class!! If you are there and review your book, based on his lectures, you will do good in class. He will ask you over & over if you understand what he is saying, if you don't, don't be shy he will explain it until you do!! EXTRA POINTS, if you missed less than 2 classes!!!",awesome
109193,ya hes funny but that doesnt help for you to get a good grade. he also takes puts off if your absent...,poor
109193,This professor is amazing! He is hilarious and makes it very fun to learn. He explains things very clearly and provides exactly what you need for each test. I really looked forward to coming to this class. My favorite class by far! I highly recommend this professor!,awesome
109193,"If you have to be at class at 8am, this is the guy you want to listen to. Fun, well prepared, high energy. Very little homework, test prep is excellent. Thoroughly enjoyed the class -- wish he taught more upper division!",awesome
109193,"mike is awesome!funny and relevant!does talk fast, but his humor helps you remember it all.if you don't get it, go to office hours or read! i didn't. i only studied 3 hours the whole semester and got an A. listen, take notes, and you'll do fine. only complaint is that he ALWAYS has sweaty pit-stains. great guy, amazing teacher. needs antiperspirant",awesome
109193,No Comments,awful
109193,"So great! Take him if you ever get the chance. He is so animated and brings the material to life! So funny and into the material that you can't help but learn a bunch from him! Great, great, great!",good
109193,take somebody else. tests are hard and a 10 page paper,awful
109193,"Great teacher, very funny.  Interesting subject...it actually MOTIVATES you, and at 8am, you need that.",awesome
109193,"TUST ME AND DONT TAKE THIS CLASS!!yeah he's funny,and entertaining,but you learn nothing during the lectures, and you need to learn everything your self!the book is BORING!you have four tests ad he drops none of them,no curves!They are hard,and unless you read word for word,and between the lines,you wont even pass(C)!i studied so much and got a C-!",awful
109193,"I wouldn't take him again. I had to read the book and the tests are very confusing. The 10 page paper that we had to write, weren't even graded fairly. cuz he didn't do it he has a TA doing his stuff. Take my advice, you'll be doing all the work on your own. I didn't pay money for me to only read the book and understand nothing from the lectures.",poor
109193,This teacher is absolutely amazing. He hardly makes you use the book you just have to listen to the lecture. He is funny as hell trust me.he talks really fast but has the funniest examples and actions your stomach will hurt. The tests are hard but just pay attenetion you&quot;ll only be there for like 40 min anyway. VERY GOOD,awesome
109193,"Wonderful teacher!Without a doubt, take him!Need to read the book,but can pass without reading!Alot of the material is common sense. Every class was like going to a comedy club for free!=)Would take him again if I could!!",awesome
109193,The man is a disaster!He's all over the place!His lectures are not clear and I didn't feel like he covered much of the book.,poor
109193,"easy class, and interesting. i actually looked forward going to this class every morning. the tests are easy as long as you study and pay attention in class. HE IS A VERY FUNNY DUDE, he will make you laugh daily guaranteed.",awesome
109193,Funniest guy ever! Lectures are really interesting. There is a writing requirement paper and four tests total. You'll do fine as long as you read the notes and the summary section of the book.,good
109193,he is so much fun. this is the only class that i looked foward in actually going there is only four tests and no finals,awesome
109193,"This guy rocks, I took him at Valley and was able to take him here for my gen ed",awesome
109193,GREAT teacher! very energetic and hilarious. Just pay very close attention to his lectures and read the book. can't go wrong with gardner.,awesome
109193,Great teacher! You won't regret taking him if you want that A,awesome
109193,Yes yes yes. This was the only class at CSUN I've ever WANTED to go to.  He's hilarious and makes the information really easy to understand.,awesome
109193,"I've taken 2 of Dr. Gardner's classes and I find them simply amazing! He is such a great professor. Even if you dont receive a good grade, you'll absorb so much info and he makes it so easy and fun! Great class",awesome
109193,He was one of the best teachers i've ever had at CSUN. He talks constantly about his wife and makes the whole class laugh.,good
109193,"This guy is hilarious. Very fun teacher, very fun class. There are only 4 tests and that's it. The tests are difficult tho, so that can be a good or bad thing. You MUST read, you MUST study. But he makes biopsych as interesting as it could possibly be. Love him!",awesome
109193,He is a good teacher but you have to read the book to do well in the class. You have four test in his class and that's your grade.,average
109193,u have to read ahead to pass the class. other then that he is a funny guy,good
109193,"His lectures are funny and interesting, but useless. Doesn't help in the exam. and signing the attendence sheet is such a pain (imagine if you were only late for 3 mins). You'll need to read the textbook before exams.",average
109193,"His class was very interesting. it definitely woke me up in the morning. He was very energetic and enthusiastic about what he was teaching.the tests are off the lectures,but read the book to go into detail if you want an A. overall it was a great class!",good
109193,oh my god! what can i say about him&#63; his class was in the morning and i am totally not a morning person but he totallyyy woke me up! Soooooo funnny he's unbelievable. there were 4 tests and he drops one. one paper which his T.A grades. u have to read the book from front to back and read ahead! he's awesome tho i love this guy! take him!!,good
109193,"BEST PROFESSOR EVER! his lectures are SO funny you will WANT to go to his classes. I never missed his class. read your textbook, LISTEN to his lectures, no need to take notes because he talks fast, but he makes it clear. Tests are clear. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! =) *thumbs up*",awesome
109193,"He is just everywhere in the class. He makes the subject interesting and fun. He tells stories, and makes the weirdest funkiest noises but it keeps you awake early in the morning with a good laugh. Go to his class because he goes over the things that you need to read in the book. Read ahead! overall, an awesome prof. I'd recommend him to anyone!",awesome
109193,Full of energy.  His lectures and the text almost go hand in hand.  Make sure you dont miss class.  he is good at clarifying concepts in the book,awesome
109193,One of the most oddest professors you will have in your life. He creates an lively environment with his hyper personality. Clearly understands his material. It's easy if you pay attention and take notes. This is one of the must have professors at csun.,awesome
109193,"Like the teacher but hate the class. It's one of those classes that all you do is take notes and take tests. You really have to read the book to know your stuff. If you are good at taking test then take him, but if your bad at it, I recommend you take another teacher.",average
109193,My favorite professor. He's so funny and nice. he makes boring topics interesting. easy tests.,good
109193,"One of the funniest people I've ever had the pleasure of encountering. I never took notes, but I read the book before tests. GO TO CLASS. He explains things very well, and he's friggin hilarious. I just went to hear stories about him and his girlfriend.",awesome
109193,Mike is awesome. Can't say he's easy b/c you really have to know your stuff but he makes it fun to learn. His tests are single and group tests. You get the higher grade if you're within a 5 range deviation which helps a lot. Pay attention to his lecture and READ the book. You HAVE to do both. Study and you'll get an A.,awesome
109193,Funniest most energetic Prof. at CSUN. Tests are alittle complicated need to read and comprehend concepts.,awesome
109193,At 1st he's really cool cuz he talks fast and makes jokes but then it gets old and he rambles on and on. You have to sign in everyay and his tests are from book not so much about the lectures.  Write down every detail about the paper cuz the T.A grades it and she's tough.,good
109193,"one of csun's classic Worse Teacher EVER. Students beware. i faild his class and im a C student. I did his paper, showed up to class every time (and signed in that lame sign in sheet) Got D and Fail's on tests and got a Fail in the class. NICE GUY but huge ass after he grades ur test &quot;on a curve&quot;  DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!!!! =x",awful
109193,"Gardner is one of the best professors I've ever had.  He truly loves teaching and it shows.  His lectures are a lot of fun and often interesting.  You look forward to his class, even though it starts at 8:00AM.  Highly recommended.  There's also a ludicrous, arbitrary paper graded solely on following picky formatting guidelines.",awesome
109193,"not the most organized, but not entirely all over the place. Mike has his way of teaching a class, he's extremely talkative but also very knowledgeable! if u paid attention in class you would see he does too make sense! i always looked forward to his class, and attendance is important, so make sure you go.",awesome
109193,"He talks EXTREMELY fast during lectures and it's difficult to interpret and take notes during class. Basically you must read the text book before attending lectures are you will NOT understand the lecture. Attendance is mandatory, and there is only 4 test. The only required homeowokk if you want a good grade is reading the text book.",good
109193,"Mike is dope. Yeah, he's all over the place but what he has to say is interesting and informative so LISTEN! He'll teach you 50% of the test. The other 50% u get from the book. He has group tests & solo tests which help ALOT! Come to class & pay attention. PARTICIPATE also. He loves that & it doesnt hurt when ur between an A & B at grading time.",awesome
109193,Professor Gardner is a great teacher.  Taking his class was helpful in helping me understand human motivation.  I do suggest to those who are interested in taking this class to read the book cuz the tests are based on it and the notes.,awesome
109193,"TAKE NOTES!!!!  No matter how fast you have to write or how disorganized his lectures are, take notes!!  If you take notes and study them, youll get an A easy.  His class is fun and interesting, but all over the place.",awesome
109193,"He isn't the most organized guy.. but he is funny and nice. He keeps your attention, but to pass the class you must read the book. You basically teach yourself.. but you have to show up because attendance is taken. He's a nice guy.. just not the most organized teacher. You have to be really prepared to read yourself and teach yourself.",average
109193,"Fun teacher! Don't miss class, don't miss test, take notes, and read the book! If not your'e not going to pass!",average
109193,"Professor Gardner is a lot of fun. HOWEVER don't get distracted. People sometimes forget to take notes because of his engaging lectures. His class isn't terribly difficult. Just do what you're supposed to, and you'll do fine.",good
109193,"Mr. Gardner is a very energetic professor and enjoys teaching also. The only problem is that he doesn't relate to his students as individuals. After I took two classes with him, he still didn't remember my name. He calls on people by saying stuff like, &quot;you in the back,&quot; or &quot;how about you in the orange shirt.&quot; Other than that, he's a great teacher.",good
109193,"Dr. Gardner make statistics FUN, if you can believe that!  It takes an amazing professor to make something as awful as Stats fun.  He does expect you to know your stuff though, but it always willing to help if you are unsure of something.  I highly recommend him.",good
109193,"Gardner is one funny guy. You'll really enjoy coming to his class. Tests are ok, you just need to read the material to do well on them. The paper he gives only has to be 3 pgs, plus some notes, and it's fairly easy.",good
109193,"He is a VERY HARD TEACHER...he is funny and kept me awake at 8 am mwf but he is very difficult to understand..the tests are very hard and he grades hard to...i have never almost fail a class until i took this one and since i have to take it again, I WILL NOT take it with him...",poor
109193,"He is very unorganized and acts like he doesn't care about the paper, but he does! Be sure to write enough journals. He is fun to watch, but the test are from the book, so his lectures are pointless. His test are hard if you don't read every detail and study!",average
109193,"He is fun to watch and loves what he teaches, but his test are tricky and complicated, there is four test, and no cumulative finl.",good
109193,"Gardner is very fun. He was passionate about what he was teaching, and that made me more interested in learning the material. He does talk VERY fast and it's hard to take notes, so you should read the material about a day ahead of time so you can fully understand what he is talking about. If psych is hard for you, take someone else cuz he goes fast",good
109193,"Hey is a great professor. Jumps from one topic to another so you cannot really take notes, although he is willing to help if you need help. If you read what he assigns you to read you will do fine.",good
109193,"Gardner is HILARIOUS!! he is a great teacher, tests are all multiple choice really easy, he is totally laid back.. i had a blast in his class.. dont need to buy the book, i got an A, just by lectures, attendance is important to him tho, so go to class ull have fun there anyway!",awesome

109193,"I am not taking the lass to have fun and laugh alot, I am here to learn the material becasue if I don't know, I won't in Graduate school.... Talking as fast as the speed of a light doesn't HELP.....",average
109193,"The truth is that we are not in elementry school anymore and the fact that Gardner makes us feel good about the class is Good. However; when you take a &quot;science&quot; type of a class, you want the instructor to lecture in a way that will be follow-able. Talking super fast and throwing the material to people at 100 Miles per hour is goning to help......",awesome
109193,He is fun and makes class interesting!  Keeps me awake...very funny!,awesome
109193,"He is very funny and nice, but his lecture is unorganized.  He jumps one topic to another and never stops.  He is against note-taking, but it takes more time to study with your textbook.  I enjoy attending his class, but I have to read my textbook very carefully to clarify the lecture.",awful
109193,Very entertaining. 6 yrs later I still remember him as being one of the best teacher's I've had at the university.,good
109193,very funny..,good

109193,"He is very funny and interesting but when the test comes, the questions don't apply to the notes.  You need to study the book not the notes.  Overall a cool class",awesome
109193,"Excellent professor, he is funny and keeps your interest. Only one thing, he talks very fast and it is hard to take notes, just read and you will be fine.",good
109193,One of the best teachers in the world. I loved his class. I hope to take him again. He is straight to the point and does not complicate the subject he is teaching. He is so motivated and also the reason why I became a psy major.More teahcers should be like him. you would be a fool not to take him.,awesome
109193,Coolest teacher ever! He is so easy and has a great passion for teaching this subject. He made the class funny and interesting. Tests are easy once you get the hang of the format.Got an easy A.,awesome
109193,"AWESOME professor! he is a great inspiration, because of him, i still want to continue with psychology as my major! very motivated adn jittery guy. we make the subject interesting and fun, knows what he's talking about, recommend to everyone",awesome
109193,"this professor is the most difficlt teacher i have ever had in my whole enteral life. he talks so fast in class, and you will not understand any thing he saying. his doesn't have any grading skill or teaching skill. you will be a fool to take him for a class. i will never tell anyone to take him for a class. [he his a  very bad bad bad teacher].",awful
109193,COOL TEACHER...YOU CAN TELL THAT HE REALLY WANTS HIS STUDENTS TO LEARN!,awesome
109193,"if you need to learn motivation, this is the right professor for the job. the lectures are all fun and games but the tests are challenging. a very animated teacher who will keep you awake even at 8am but hard to keep up with because he has 10 thoughts coming in at once. skips from one thought to another. really need to read the book.",good
109193,"Coolest teacher ever, no final or midterm.  His lectures are soooo interesting and fun.  He really makes you understand and apply the info.  If you read the book and take notes you will pass with an A no problem.  Go to class on time everyday and you get extra credit and by doing the experiments that are manditory your grade is bumped up. GRT CLASS",awesome
109193,"I totally slacked in his class and never went he's a real stickler about attendance and gives you 12 bonus points at the end of the semester. I should have done better, i would def. take him again. Just four tests that are multiple choice...no midterm, no final, no paper...go to class or at least sign in and read read read the book!!!!",awesome
109193,"Funny guy and very smart but has some strange ideology issues. His review days are an absolute ridiculous joke because he literally stands in front of class, opens the book and goes page by page simply reading the subheadings and then closes the book and says goodbye. He seriously does this and gives no specifics. Funny but not easy.",average
109193,This man is crazy which is the charm about this professor. He literally bounces off the walls during lectures. I had him for a 9am course and everyday he woke everyone up. This is how crazy and active he gets during class...his shirt is soaking wet and the end of class. Class is easy but you have to read to do well.,awesome
109193,"i took this guy like 4 years ago and i STILL recommend him to everyone-very friendly personality, explains this in a funny and simple manner, could it get any better to have a teacher like this&#63; i wish he taught my bio classes!",awesome
109193,No Comments,good
109193,"Doesnt deserve Phd in Psychology, He doesn't even guide students on how to take his tests. The book and lectures are barely any help to the tests, which are based more on &quot;if&quot; situations. Very dissapointed.",awful
109193,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! HIS TESTS ARE REALLY UNCLEAR, U CAN STUDY THE BOOK ALL U WANT ( BECAUSE HE DOESNT GIVE GOOD LECTURES I KNOW MORE ABOUT HIS DEAD FIANCE THAN PSYCHOLOGY!!!) EVEN IF U READ THE BOOK, HE DOESNT GIVE STRAIGHTFORWARD QUESTIONS AND DOES &quot;CRITICAL THINKING&quot; IN REALITY ITS BS! DO NOT TAKE HIm!!!!!!",awful
109193,very easy class. take it if u want an easy A. as long as u read ahead youll be ok. hes cool at first but then gets really annoying cuz he preaches his beliefs and doesnt let anyone disagree with him. he knows his stuff but he goes too fast and skips around from subject to subject. dont sit in the front unless u like being spit all over,average
109193,Don't be fooled! He might ssem like a cool professor and you may enjoy his lectures but that will come to an end after you see the test score you get.Difficult class to study for because he goes too fast and most of the lecture has nothing to do with the tests.See how much you like him after the tst,average
109193,He was ok... i felt he was very hard even after taking good notes and reading the book.. his grading scale is very weird.. class is interesting.. but after this i lost my interest in psych... hes pretty funny but i think he doesnt care much about his students. Oh yea be prepared for experiments.....,average

109193,Best Prof ever. Shows great concern for his students. Always willing to help. He is also extremely funny making students look forward to attending class. Doesn't test you on anything he hasn't talked about. Take good notes in class and you'll get an A guaranteed.,awesome
109193,"Was hillarious but a bit sweaty, wear some protective gear if you sit in the front.  Will be a class you remember afer college.  He would make the information relevant to everyday life.  The quizes online for the books helped me a lot, and lectures entertaining, but the videos made me a bit sleepy.",awesome
109193,"THIS CLASS RULES! If you want 1 hour of straight-standup comedy. Take his class. The readings are very easy and reasonable 50pages/week. I never read and I still got A's on the test. His class is so darn easy and so funny, EVERYONE should TAKE this class. I woulda took this class just for fun!",awesome
109193,"He is awesome, even at 8 in the morning. Full of energy and a great guy to talk to after class.  You learn a ton, but the tests aren't easy. Look for study questions from the internet site on the back of the book.",awesome
109193,"he is the most entertaining teacher ever! he  makes psych very interesting and worth learning. be sure to pay attention and take notes and read b/c there are 4 exams. if you get him for a small class, you get to take exams in a group. i was in a class of 150 students, so i was on my own on tests.",awesome
109193,"GREAT teacher, loves what he does. very inspiring. funny. i highly recommend him.",awesome
109193,"This man is the funniest, coolest, most entertaining, nicest, and most inspiring man I've ever had as a teacher.  He loves what he does and I loved going to his class everytime; he brought the subject to life, and I'm going to miss his class a lot.  Simply the best professor I've ever had.",awesome
109193,HE IS GREAT PROFESSOR. HE CARE ABOUT ALL IF THE STUDENT IN CLASS.,awesome
109193,"Enthusiastic about what he is teaching and absolutely one of the GREATEST teachers I have ever had!! He uses real-life examples to teach every single concept, and it works perfectly. I walk out of every class feeling enlightened. Tests are easy if you know the material. Read the book and show up.",awesome
109193,"One of the best teachers at CSUN! He's very
 enthusiastic and funny! He makes you want to pay attention. Great class, fair tests, very interesting!!",awesome
109193,Very upbeat class! It is really interesting. As long as you go to class and read you'll be fine.,awesome
109193,"always sweating...he is so hyper that you can't even take notes or undrestand the lecture.If you don't read the book, you'll barely pass with a C. Fun and easy class, too. multiple choice test and stuff.only if he wasn't so hyper!!",good
109193,Yes the prof.is energetic & fun but the class is a challenge. The test are difficult and if you arent a good note taker then your next best thing would be to understand what the book says. No matter what you have to study and really understand the materia,good
109193,"Very fun, very funny man and he plays basketball",awesome
109193,He was awesome!! I took him three years ago and he is still my favorite!! everytime i went to class it felt like i was attending an educational comic show..i loved it,good
109193,really wants to have people actually learn and makes it as much fun as possible.,awesome
109193,"Dont see why many people give him the thumbs up. Yes, he is &quot;very very&quot; funny and energetic but once those tests come its over. By him being a nice and funny guy doesnt mean its a good class. Its a difficult class and difficult to earn a decent",good
109193,very funny,good
109193,great teacher but hard tests.. u have to study in order to pass the tests... but he is definately an outgoing teacher,awesome
109193,"Great, energenic, adament professor. He gives notes that coincide perfectly with the book.  His tests are very tricky, but if you take great notes you'll do fine. The funniest teacher ever and I would recommend to anyone and everyone. Class is interesting",awesome
109193,"very cool guy. if you have him early, dont worry, he will wake you up. his lectures are fun and useful. psy isnt my major, but this class was interesting.",awesome
109193,No Comments,awesome
109193,He is by far the best professor I have ever had.  He has so much energy and you can tell he loves his job.  I wish every professor I had loved teaching as much as he does,awesome
109193,"Best. Professor. Ever. I actually looked forward to coming to class at 8:00am, and it takes me 45 minutes to get to CSUN! Tons of energy and a great sense of humor. If only all professors were like him!",awesome
109193,"Best Professor ever had at CSUN!!! He'll keep you awake and entertain! A very friendly guy, not strict at all. He's very hyper though but overall I wish I had him as a professor in all my classes. Gardner gets an A+!",awesome
109193,"This is the coolest professor ever! It isn't an easy A, but there is no homeword, just reading! No midterm or final either. Big class, but one you won't fall asleep in!",good
109193,"very enthusiastic, funny, enjoyable class experience, even at 8am.",good
109193,He is funny makes the class enjoyable and actually motivates you to go to class. When it comes to his test they make you think and are kinda hard. Take his class he is very helpful and understanding. Trust me you will never have a professor like this one.,awesome
109193,very funny teacher !!! He is the best. I loved going to his class. Enjoyed his teaching method. He is Recommended.,awesome
109193,No Comments,awesome
109193,Gardner: |The Freudian basher&quot; is a funny guy. He teaches and keeps you entertained at the same time. Even at 9am he's energized and sweating as usual. The videos he shows in class are entertaining as well. Expect to have a good time.,awesome
109193,"I thought he was a great teacher.  He had a lot of energy, and was always making us laugh and feel comfy and not bored at all.  Just read the book and focus on the stuff the talks about, and you will pass your exams.  He curves a lot too!",good
109193,"Dr. Gardner is very passionate and energetic, which makes the class very interesting. He gives the best examples and there will be times that you will laugh uncontrollably. He talks really fast, but just write down the main concepts.",average
109193,"This teacher is the best teacher on campus. If you get him as your teacher, you will definitely be satisfied. He is fun and exciting, the class will turn out to be your favorite class ever.",awesome
109193,"Gardner is very entertaining and his class is easy. If you need one-on-one attention from your professor, then perhaps Gardner isn't the right professor for you because he is exteremely busy and rarely had time to really explain things except in class.",awesome
109193,"Very passionate, more videos than you care to see. Tests are challenging, but there's a curve.  Funny guy, no fallin asleep in this class.  Very interesting class, fast paced, not impossible to get a decent grade,nearly impossible to get an A.",good
109193,has a lot of energy and his examples in class do help make learning the subject easier.,awesome
109193,"He is definately an energetic professor, but he's not that helpful when it comes to teaching.",poor
109193,very funny guy,awesome
109193,"Seriously great. This guy is halarious, and on top of that, extremely lenient. His lectures are worth listening to even if you're not in the class!!!",awesome
109193,I recommend taking his class especially for non Psych major and also if you do not have so much passion to study Psychology(yet)but have to take this class. You will enjoy listening his lecture whole semester without without being boring being in a class.,awesome
109193,No Comments,good
109193,full of energy. the funniest guy ever! makes class interesting. a must take professor! all based on notes!,awesome
109193,Very entergetic. Tests are ok.,average
109193,I am currently taking his course and you will never ever meet another instuctor who is more passionate about what he does.  He is super hyper and really wants you to learn.  Very entertaining!!!,awesome
109193,Teaches other psych classes as well.  I strongly recommend him.,awesome
109193,"this fool is tight.  he's real clear, and has a grip of energy.",awesome

109193,Best class I ever took at CSUN! This professor is phenomenal!,awesome
112641,Renzi is phenomenal. He's not your buddy and he's not some new professor looking to get good recs. He's your professor. Be a student and you will learn. Let your TAs prove why your 'outside insights' are wrong in recitation.,awesome
112641,"He claims that this class is not philosophical, but I beg to differ. I've never taken a 'philosophy class' before. It has never been an interest, and that still hasn't changed. HOWEVER, I will not deny that I learned alot. It was a pretty good experience, even if it was my last choice for a Texts and Ideas class. Buy the books online! It's cheaper.",average
112641,Lectures are horrible- repeat his opinions from them on any test/paper. He isn't receptive to outside insight from students. No feedback on graded work/exams. No handouts/grades posted online so you'll never feel confident in how you're doing in the course. GO TO RECITATION- your TA is your best friend if this guy is your professor.,poor
112641,"The course is not meant to be an easy A, plain and simple. There is no doubt the material is demanding, but you CAN do well by paying attention and looking to understand the texts. I've honestly learned more in this class than I ever expected. It's one of those where every grade is fought for and satisfying. If you want to coast, look elsewhere.",awesome
112641,"The class was interesting, but also really difficult. Besides him being kind of arrogant, he only accepts his point of view. BUT the TAs and weight of assignments help. I got a C on the first midterm (8% of grade), a B on the second midterm (I think like 12%?), but did well on a few papers and ended with an A-. Not an impossible class!",average
112641,"While I enjoyed much of the material covered in this course and loved the readings, this was a VERY DIFFICULT class. Yes, Renzi is arrogant but my frustrations stemmed from his overly particular grading style. You may learn a lot and have interesting theories, but if you dont regurgitate his lectures from class, your grade suffers. Not my style.",poor
112641,"Very hard class, one of the hardest I've taken at NYU. However, the content is interesting, and he is an engaging speaker so lectures are never boring. Take notes very carefully as the lecture is very detail-packed and everything in the lecture will be on the exam. One of the most challenging but fascinating classes I've ever taken",average
112641,"Not much grade inflation  he keeps it real. If that's not your thing, don't take him (there are other, easier 'Texts and Ideas' classes). Sometimes he's very sanctimonious, but he's passionate with a real point of view. I learned a lot from this class. From my experience, you have to do the readings to get a good grade.",good
112641,"Professor is arrogant and insufferable, but the class is trivially easy. You barely even have to do the readings if you pay attention in recitation and maybe scribble occasional notes in lecture. I don't really get the complaints about the difficulty, as I didn't even read any of the books and still pulled an A-...",average
112641,Lectures are well detailed. EXTREMELY difficult readings. A hard grader. isn't clear about what he wants from you. DO NOT TAKE THIS TEXTS AND IDEAS CLASS.,poor
112641,"So far, the worst professor I've ever taken at NYU. Both, his personality and teaching skills aren't the best for an educational place. One day, I listened to him saying to one of his TA's to grade essay and HW assignments hardly. I totally understand he wants us to learn, but a C- on a paper that was workshopped three times is just unfair. AVOID!",awful
112641,I would highly recommended especially if you're interested in philosophy. It is extremely hard but was the most rewarding required class I had to take freshman year. Renzi is tough but very reasonable he doesn't hand out As but the TAs usually have your back. The readings were hard but super interesting,awesome
112641,Vincent Renzi was one of the biggest disappointments that I have had at NYU. Don't take him unless you want to tank your GPA.,poor
112641,"Brilliant guy, extremely knowledgeable and he knows that he knows more than you do about the subject. If you are active he will like you and then will help the course fit you. So far, my favorite professor at NYU",awesome
112641,"Rude, unhelpful, full of himself. I do not recommend him.",awful
112641,"Renzi runs the MAP program (the required courses for CAS) so he takes his REQUIRED course very seriously. The course material, essay prompts and quizzes are very difficult to make sense of and he grades incredibly harshly. It's not what a required class should be, and he's a really rough dude. I once tried to shake his hand and he told me no.",poor
112641,"This class was a huge waste of my life but I was expecting that from Texts & Ideas. Just don't take this professor, he requires attendance and is really patronizing about it. Lectures are tedious. This class is not too difficult though, just three short essays and three exams, you don't really need to do the readings either.",average
112641,"A great professor!! Only thing is the class is really hard! Especially for students like me, because my major is not Philosophy and I understand about it very little. BUT if I take it now again! I can rock the hell out of it! Because now I learned a lot from Dr Renzi and our TA.",awesome
112641,"The Best. He is helpful if you actively seek help.No BS. He is as clear as possible given the philosophical[here, synonymous with 'challenging' and 'thought-provoking] nature of the texts with which you will deal. It will take you DECADES to thoroughly sort through Nietzsche and Plato, and even then you will still have questions unanswered.",awesome
112641,"This class is very demanding. The TAs are great though. You can understand everything, be able to articulate it on paper and still only get a B sadly. Renzi often seems arrogant while lecturing and presents the material subjectively which completely disinterested me.",average
112641,"DO NOT TAKE PROFESSOR RENZI'S CLASS. He is a very intelligent man, but he is 100% unwilling to give anyone an A for anything. You can read all the novels, come to all the lectures, go to all the office hours and still barely scrape a B. For a required class, this is flat-out ridiculous. Take another Texts and Ideas course. Please.",average
112641,no.,poor
112641,"This class has made me never ever want to read a book again in my life. Like, ever.",average
112641,"You people act as though ancient philosophy and college-level writing are supposed to be easy. You should know what the difference is between an intelligent, thought-provoking question and dumb 'logistical question' about a final exam. Heaven forbid someone asks you to think critically or independently!",average
112641,"I took the Writing Intensive, but I never thought it was going to be so difficult. It is definitely one of the most challenging courses I've ever had to take. At first, it seems daunting, maybe impossible, but it gets a lot better. JUST MAKE SURE TO TAKE NOTES. I wrote down everything he said, and it made everything 1000x easier.",average
112641,"I had him for Text and Ideas: Writing Intensive. He is very intelligent and if you pay attention in lecture the midterm is too hard. However, he comes across as arrogant and unapproachable. Someone asked a simple, logistical question about the final and he proceed to go off on a rant about how we weren't asking him any 'intelligent' questions.",average
112641,"I took this linked with Writing the Essay, and I swear to God I've never worked so hard in my life. He's a great professor, he knows his materials, but he can be religiously offensive. The TA also grades HARSHLY. If you do not love writing and philosophy, you will STRUGGLE.",average
112641,"He isn't that scary.  He assigns a lot of reading, but you don't need read it all.  His lectures are very thorough and he points out the main passages of the reading.  You will need to work for a good grade, and he can be obnoxious sometimes, but I'd say take the class just for the experience.  Or if you just get stuck with it, don't worry.",good
112641,"While he does assign a LOT of tough reading, it it not necessary because Renzi talks in such detail about each reading assignment that it's like you read the whole book without actually having to read the book.  He is really interesting and smart.  The only problem are his exams.  They are so hard so don't take this class if you cant write fast.",awesome
112641,"His class is SO TOUGH!! There is so much reading, and so much work! It is definitely NOT worth it! He gives the hardest texts and ideas class out of any professor at NYU!",average
112641,"Really knows his stuff and explains them with clarity, he makes you see the texts like never before. But his readings are crazy for non-philo majors. Take his class if you're genuinely interested in the subject, steer clear if you're looking for an A. I probably spent 40% of my total homework time on his MAP.",good
112641,"I was waitlisted for his class during enrollment period, and as suggested by my advisor, I contacted him about this. Apparently I wasn't allowed to join his class because I missed the first week because I wasn't enrolled in it. When I asked if there was anything I could do to make up for it he asked me to travel back in time. Very funny, Renzi.",average
112641,"Strong lectures, tough grading, don't think you can bs ur way through the class its not possible. if you enjoy the material youl have a nice time but either way you will work for your b or if you r very strong an a-",good
112641,"Steer Clear! He is a great lecturer, but his grading policy sucks. I'm hoping I can pass with a pretty decent grade. This class is too labor intensive for a MAP class. If you don't like or have no interest in philosophy don't take. This class will definitely bring down your GPA. Also, one TA graded to leniently and the other too harshly. Meh!!",average
112641,"It's true, you do more work than any other Texts and Ideas class (especially if doing linked), but, if you are interested at all in the material, it's worth it. His lectures are always engaging and depending on the text, powerful. Exams can be tough if you don't read/pay attention, and papers are graded critically (but they're short!). Worth it!!!!",awesome
112641,Do not take any class he teaches. Words cannot describe...,poor
112641,"Renzi is a solid prof and doesn't mess around. Midterms,finals and essays will be good for those who read,and a nightmare for those who don't. I got an A- but I read everything and participated in recitations (which counts!!). Go to class every week-he gives pop quizzes (if people don't come,he lectures about how we don't appreciate our education).",average
112641,"Renzi is a demanding professor. He expects a lot, there is extensive reading, and his lectures cover some difficult material. That being said, I feel he is an incredible professor. I enjoyed all his lectures and they always left me thinking. His short papers are doable and as long as you show a good or interesting thought process, you'll do fine.",good
112641,"A tough professor especially on grading, but the lectures are worth it. This class helped me understand Nietzsche, Plato, Freud, Socrates, Kierkegaard, the Bible, and St. Augustine in a way I would never have on my own. He gives pop quizzes to check up on attendance, so make sure you attend every class.",awesome
112641,Had to put in 10 hours a week just for this class and ended up with an A-. It's not impossible to get an A as previous users have mentioned. It's just EXTREMELY difficult. Take this class if you are interested in philosophy and looking to read good literature and attending interesting lectures. Workload is as intense as it can get freshman year.,good
112641,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS, especially if you have no interest in philosophy. I have never struggled as much as I did in this class, the recitations are not helpful at all. Writing prompts for papers and exams are extremely complex and difficult to get a good grade on. He made lecture interesting, but I didn't feel he was very approachable or helpful.",poor
112641,"He was an amazing Professor. He was crystal clear about what he wanted. TA's are useless. D the midterm (my fault) and got B's on essays and on the final and got a B+ in the class. Not bad considering I'm majoring in Comp.Sci/Engineering. BTW, took the class Spring '11.",awesome
112641,"Antiquity & 19th Century LINKED-- NO, JUST NO! It is a GPA killer and he is the most pompous man you will ever meet.  He is hard and just wants to make your life miserable.  Save your life and do not take his class!",average
112641,DO NOT I SAID DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. YOU WILL PUT YOURSELF THROUGH HELL IF YOU TAKE THIS CLASS. I'd rather live in Antartica than ever take this class again. You have been warned!!,poor
112641,"He's incredibly smart and definitely knows his stuff, so go to all the lectures and listen intently. He has high expectations and is kind of a ****; he's also very full of himself. But at the end of the day, he's brilliant. You'll struggle hard for a B/B+, but definitely do-able. Anything in A range is practically impossible, though.",awesome

112641,"This class is hard and fast-paced, but Renzi knows what he's talking about & lectures are extremely interesting. The amount of reading is difficult to manage at times, good grades are hard to come by, & the midterm was one of the hardest tests I've had so far, but I feel like I'm actually learning in this course. Praying for a grade miracle though.",good
112641,"Before taking this class i was intimidated by what others said. But he's really not mean he's just very passionate about this subject.

112641,seriously should have listened to the guy 4 comments down when i checked this out.,poor
112641,He's arrogant and obsessed with himself. If you ask him a question he immediately attacks you. On the other hand you really never need to read or do homework other than a couple of papers. Your grade is essentially based on whether your TA is a strict grader or not.,poor
112641,"Renzi, as a person, is very interesting and is convincing with his presentation of the texts read. However, his enthralling attitude toward the texts leaves little to no room for interpretation or opinions. In short, this class is just not worth the time or energy.",poor
112641,"Professor Renzi himself is a very interesting man. I see why a lot of people have been calling him arrogant, but to me it seemed more like he played the devil's advocate. The thing with Renzi is that the TAs do all the grading and it's very hard to know what, exactly, they are looking for. This would be a great class if he had better TAs.",average
112641,just don't do it,awful

Instead of reinforcing the lecture's content, the TA's put forth their own confusing interpretations, and screw you over on the papers.",poor

All my other profs worked with me to catch up on missed work, etc. while I was sick, but Renzi failed me for attendance!! It didn't matter that I had mono and had doctor's notes.

This class is based on 3 exams for which each question is worth 1 point.",good

Useful for students who aren't used to economics concepts but unbearably boring to sit in lectures where he panders to students like we're kids. Grading system is ridiculous - one point  one percent. Some questions on tests are vaguely framed, meant to trick you, and other answers often have merit.",good

405301,There were only three assignments for this class - three tests that add up to 100 points. These are incredibly easy if you read the book and attend (at least some) lectures. Professor is a cool dude and makes the lectures entertaining. Really good for an intro level course.,good
405301,"Pretty decent class. Grading set-up is simple: every point you get wrong on the tests is a point off your average. Tests are heavily based on the textbook so if you read them closely you'll be okay, even if you miss class. The professor is entertaining and makes concepts clear and memorable. Accent was sometimes distracting, not unbearable though.",good
405301,This guy is the hardest grader you will ever have for a class with essays in it. But his lectures are engaging and eye-opening.

I barely passed.,awesome

If you dislike this class or find it hard then its a good indication you shouldn't be an econ major. There were three exams and each one got more challenging, but overall the class was pretty easy.",awesome
405301,"The materials are not that hard, but it is the way he chooses to grade that drops most people's grade. If you made one mistake on one of the exams, you lose one point on your final grade.

405301,Confusing and adds stupid questions into the exam such as history dates. But not too hard.,poor

It's doable.",good
405301,"I think Kitsikopoulos gets a bad reputation but I like him. His lectures are clear (even though he has an accent), interesting and at times funny. The main problem is his grading policy. Three tests and that's it. If you do poorly on one one the tests, an A is almost impossible. I still recommend him as a professor if you can wake up at 8 am",good

405301,"If you are GPA conscious, avoid taking this class. Your entire grade is based on 7 essays graded on a scale of 1 to 10 and it is IMPOSSIBLE to get an A. His grading of essays is more of an english class. Essay questions are very vague and you need to take notes on everything he says. Record lectures if possible and write everything down.",good
405301,Kitsikopoulos doesn't care about the students. He's probably the worst teacher  I've had at NYU. He doesn't make things clear (and I don't even mind the accent). His grading style does not promote learning. I love economics but his tests are ridiculous.,poor
405301,"I wonder why he use this grading and teaching: no homework,only test matters  your grade(he didnt even give you a sample test!!!)and my rct is just as unhelpful as himself. I asked a question no the lecture and he didnt seem want to help me, besides he has terrible accent.",average
405301,"Awesome guy! Captivating and really fun lectures. However, you really have to earn the A. It is attainable, but you must know the textbooks and concepts inside out. I highly suggest doing the readings. But besides that, he is always willing to help. He miraculously makes a 350 person lecture feel like an intimate 10 person classroom.",awesome
405301,"He has an accent, but he is funny though. he tried to teach well, but he is not so familiar with the textbook, that's true. and he doesn't really follow any syllabus at all. plus, his tests are very unfair, it's impossible to get an A. 479 students,  only 8 of them get an A.",average
405301,"Okay. If you do not want an F, do not take this class. LOL. Bottom line - your tests are the only way to obtain a good grade. Attendence doesnt count. Participation doesn't count.

He's pretty energetic & has a great accent.,awesome

405301,You can do well even without going to his classes. I only went to the first 2 lectures and then just went on exam days. Very convenient grading system (start out w/ 100 pts and then lose points by # of Q's you get wrong on exams and HW) I just read the book and studied alone and got an A. Take this class if you want an easy A!,good

He makes you do online problem sets but does not &quot;give you&quot; any points for doing them, just lowers your grade if you get too many wrong. Tests are easy, but not very representative of the material gone over during class",good
405301,"Pretty easy class. No need to attend lectures or recitations if you do the readings and graded assignments. I put only a little effort and did fairly well. The final can be a doozy because of the volume of material, but if you put a little extra effort you'll definitely get the A.",average
405301,"Horrible class. It killed my GPA. The class is required for my major and I'll have to retake, but with a different professor.

Grade bases on three test and occasional hw assignmensts. Tests arent bad, final is a little hard though. Overall I really liked him as a prof definitely recommend him.",good

405301,"Your grade is based only on 3 tests....the first 2 are easy but the final is quite hard....there is also hmk due once in a while but it only works against you...meaning that you do not gain points if you get them right, you only lose points for incorrect answers,he is a great lecturer though and u will learn alot!",awesome
405301,"He's amusing in class. The grading scale is difficult, but not impossible. His test questions (which constitute 100%  of the final grade) generally aim to trick the students, so double- and triple-checking answers is necessary. Reading the book is recommended, but his explanations give a good overview of the concepts. He does Q&A after class.",good
405301,"OK. His grading system for this class is VERY DIFFICULT. there are 7 essays, and he expects IMPECCABLE papers. If he sees comma in the wrong place on your bibliography, then you are screwed. Besides that, I loved his class, and think he is probably one of the best professors NYU has.",awesome
405301,"He focuses on trying to be funny a lot. His class is not helpful, and the test is very easy- you only have to read the book.",average
405301,the best,awesome
405301,"Funny prof that explains the concepts well even when digressing into stories. From time to time goes on rants (sometimes audience interactive!) about the current adm. but does so in an economically logical sense. Occasionally not,but overall still an enjoyable class and don't be late, he'll rip you to shreds. Tests ok if you read the book and study",awesome
405301,"Honestly, avoid this prof because he spends more time entertaining the class than teaching the material. He never adequately prepared the class for tests, and the grading system was bogus (even though it helped me.) I stressed more over this class because I didn't know what to expect, and it was one that I took in high school.",poor

405301,Professor never shuts up about Iraq and why Bush and his macroecon theory are ****. He does not spend enough time reinforcing the concepts provided in the book - he wastes his time trying to appeal to students rather than focus on the material. Never goes over problems like you'd see on the tests. Avoid for someone competent.,poor
405301,"Absolutely hilarious professor. Worth going to lecture even if you don't like Econ because he puts on a show. Likes to get students involved, makes subject matter more interesting and understandable. Study for tests, don't mess up homeworks and you should be okay. Not the easiest, but most worth-while class.",awesome
405301,Outstanding professor! History of Economic Thought class was fascinating and intellectually challenging.,awesome
405301,"Funny, interesting, eccentric professor.  Very good at whipping out examples that make concepts much easier to understand.  Do well on the first test though, because if you don't, you are pretty much in a hole for the rest of the semester.",awesome
405301,"DO NOT take him for history of economic thought. If you do, make sure you write down every word he says and regurgitate it in your essays. Don't attempt to be creative or draw conclusions, as there is only one way to look at the material, which is his way.  The most disapointing class i've taken at NYU.",poor
405301,Great guy. Study up for tests and dont screw up homeworks and you will be just fine. Grading system is a little different but really doesn't make that much of a difference. Interesting lectures and pretty funny,good

Has a good sense of humor, and gets the class to crack up every once in a while. He knows what he is doing. watch out for aplia though.",awesome
405301,The professor's grading system makes the course unnecessarily difficult. Points are deducted from your grade as the semester progresses. There is no room for improvement. Your grade just progressively drops. The material used is overly technical for an introductory course. Nothing is memorable. There is no theory and all equations. Boring.,average

405301,he's the best... just watch out for aplia,awesome
405301,"Really nice and funny professor.  His grading seems a little ambiguous, but I still recommend him.  He's not at all hard to understand if you pay attention, but you most likely will be because he'll call you out on it if he sees that you're not.  Overall recommended.",awesome
405301,"Simply amazing, I enjoyed and loved hi, u will too",awesome

405301,He's hilarious.  If you show up to class and read the chapters you should be fine.  Do the textbooks multiple choice tests online because he gets his test questions from the publisher.  Recitations were NOT helpful...don't go to them if you keep up with the readings and class.,good
405301,I managed to stay awake and show up on a fairly frequent basis in an 8 am class.  Very funny.  His accent is a bit hard to understand sometimes but he's the best professor I've had so far at NYU.,awesome

405301,"Great teacher, but a little hard to understand. If you can keep on top of your work and the reading, you'll be great, but you're whole grade is just three tests. And make sure you go to class when he tells you to since there's 2 lectures that ARE NOT in the book and are not covered by the TA's!",good
405301,"Just to the left of Karl Marx, and speaks his mind, so be warned. English is ok, but can be hard to understand.

Orgo I was an incredibly difficult course, and while the material covered in Orgo II is objectively harder, the smaller class size and access to practice problems made it much more fun!

Do all of Tom's homeworks, review sheets, group problems, practice exams, go to review sessions, and do yourself a favor and go to lecture (even if it's 8 am).

Terrible class.",poor

Not easy, but worth it to take from him.",awesome

1052652,Jones is effective at teaching orgo. He's knowledgable and has come up with a good structure for the class (especially if you're in the majors section).

Tests on material often outside the level of difficulty presented in the homework and class. I did well because of the hours I put in, not because of him.",poor
1052652,Orgo is a hard class and Id rather take Jones anyday.  He focuses on the how and why and doesnt just expect you to memorize.

Overall a great professor.,good

1052652,"At first, I was also very upset and thought this class was impossible. To do well, you have to figure out how to approach the questions on the exam. Once you do, you will get grades that show for it. Read nonstop and do all the questions from princeton and book & look for patterns. I did that and got above an 80 on every exam the second semester.",awful

By the way, the class isn't curved (a lot of people failed 101), so the &quot;dumb people&quot; don't make it any easier for you orgo geniuses. Jones can't be held responsible for the fact that his A students are incapable of reasoning, but be aware that the usual smarts will not get you an A.",average
1052652,"MJ is seriously the best.  If you have any common sense you will do fine in this class.  Read his textbook and know his textbook, I mean he wrote it so it's clearly important.  Practice exams, do tons of problems (understand them most importantly), and you seriously will be fine. Hard&#63; No.  Intellectually challenging&#63; Sure.",awesome
1052652,"Quiet frankly the easiest class I have taken at NYU as a chemistry major. Jones is so loving and caring for his students and provides maximal preparation for exams, which I think because of the dumb people I didn't need to even study for them.Easy A if you have a little common sense. Spent most of my time studying linear algebra in his class!",awesome
1052652,"This is the worst class you could ever subject yourself to. I got an A, and I'm still saying this. Lectures are nothing but Jones going on random tangents, and he has no office hours to go over what he has &quot;taught&quot;. The TAs barely speak English. You must teach yourself. Keep up with the reading, do sample exams and problems. Still very difficult",poor
1052652,"Im a trad student and this class is not impossible in any way. This is a very hard class but if you do all the suggested problems, old tests, etc. you will be more than fine. If you put in the time you won't get 30s and 40s on the exams. This class is meant to be a weed out class. If you want it enough youll do well.",average
1052652,"hehehe because of Jones, I had the experience of studying (really) the hardest in my life. :)",awful
1052652,"Definition of a weed-out class. Jones is very intelligent, but very arrogant, and does not help students. He holds &quot;question sessions&quot; instead of office hours, and I personally have had an orgo class (recitation/lab) during every single one of them.  TA's just tell you to read the book if you have a question and have no interest in teaching.",poor
1052652,"non trad is the only way to get slightly around jones's incomprehensible babbling. his exams are terrible, and he tries to trick you at every turn. he doesn't care about his students or helping them learn. lectures are basically the textbook (because he IS the textbook). boring old man whose teaching style is talking to himself.",poor
1052652,All I did was study and still got 30s and 40s on every exam. I knew the information on quizzes but his exams were not fair at all.,poor
1052652,"I've never studied harder for a class in my life.  Lecture is a waste of time as he has the textbook memorized (because he wrote it, of course).  He refuses to meet with you to help you or to even talk to you after class!  Exams reflect none of the material &quot;taught&quot; in class...specifically our final...Diels Alder reaction on Orgo I final&#63;  Nice.",awful
1052652,"Even if I had done well in the class, I wouldn't say he's any good. Getting a 30 on the final after straight 10s in quizzes shows MJ does not reward intelligence or hard work.",awful
1052652,"He is the WORST professor you could ever get. His teaching is horrible, he makes absolutely no sense. His book is pages of crap bounded together. You study your butt off and still end up getting a 30 on a test. He doesn't believe in meeting with you, so don't bother. You think he's a nice guy in the beginning, but it's not true. DON'T TAKE HIM",awful
1052652,"He goes down as one of the worst professors I've ever had.  You have NO idea what to study for on exams.  His textbook is more useless than a map without names.  I would suggest getting Organic chemistry by Bruice; it's far more clear and actually gives you mechanisms, not bull!!  Lecture is completely worthless. Good luck if you're stuck with him.",awful
1052652,"Professor Jones' class was the best one I took in college. He is an asset to the university. If you have to take organic chemistry, don't miss out by taking another professor.",good
1052652,Really easy. Studied the night before the exam and got +20 pts higher than average always. his lecture is pretty much useless. Just go over the book and do problems,poor
1052652,He is a terrible teacher. He goes on many tangents and does not really explain thing very well. Textbook is useless...he doesn't really follow it. TAs in recitation are not very good. Don't take him(especially not in Non-Trad). Ridiculous that I have to self-tech myself. Had to buy another textbook to study. Got a B after using different textbook.,poor
1052652,This is a totally unbiased comment since I have not taken a test in this class yet. I want to comment that Jones is not clear about what is on the test until 500 students demand an answer. Read everything even if he does not cover it because apparently it is on the test. Basically paying 50k to teach myself organic chemistry.,awful
1052652,"The most inflexible man on earth. You could have a death of someone close to you and he still wont give a crap. You could have mental health issues and he would not care. He'll just fail you anyway with no way around it, even if you needed to pass to graduate. One day, I am sure, when things go rough on him and he gets no help, ill say KARMA!",awful
1052652,"Even though I love his textbook, he is a hard grader and didn't curve at ALL even though the average was really, really low. The TAs are the worst of the TAs that I have ever met. Beware of the TA with the TK initials because she doesn't give any partial credits! I had to get my exams regraded because of her and thankfully got my points.",good
1052652,"Worst professor ever. He is arrogant to the boot, although warranted he refuses to teach students. NYU students can't do anything since he's the only teacher, but if you ask him questions about something at times he might outright refuse you. Worst teacher in the history of my college career.",awful
1052652,Very knowledgeable and passionate about orgo.  I love his lectures. (I'm in non-trad.)  They're clear and he helps you understand the concepts but you have to study hard too.  Lecture is definitely not enough.  You can't be lazy in this class and are expected to keep up. His exams are very difficult but fair game.  85 is A.  Average is ~60-75.,awesome
1052652,"Please please please don't be scared of this class (non-traditional, especially). Jones is an *excellent* lecturer and a great teacher. Is very friendly and helpful in one-on-one interactions (at least to non-trad students) and tests are relatively easy after doing group problems (grades are heavily curved). VERY passionate about chemistry. TAKE!",awesome
1052652,"Jones is an effective and clear lecturer, but it's hard to get individual help in the course, because he's too busy (doesn't have office hours) and the TA's don't speak English.  I've been in NYC my whole life and expect difficulties communicating with taxi drivers and store owners, but it shouldn't have to be that way with my teachers.",good
1052652,"Funny, engaging professor. The class has hundreds of people but he makes it interesting. He cracks jokes, and the textbook (which he wrote) is also very clear and funny.",awesome
1052652,"You will do exam level problems 2/3 days a week, get lectured once a day, and still &quot;fail&quot; the exams. Exams test you on how to draw wrong mechanisms, and TAs are very arbitrary when it comes to partial credit. You can do every single group problem four times, read the textbook, know how to do every synthesis and get a 40 on the final. Awesome.",poor
1052652,"TA's are useless and cannot speak English to save their lives (I am an immigrant,and so generally more tolerant in this regard, but I cannot condone hiring TA's this bad). Robert Spencer suspiciously &quot;predicts&quot; all the questions on the test. Textbook is useless and full of corny jokes. Prof only cares about Non-trad/Honors sections. NO OFFICE HOURS",poor
1052652,Two words: Robert Spencer.,poor
1052652,"Jones is pretty much his textbook. Lectures are unnecessarily confusing, TA's can't speak english, so the only help you'll truly get is from reading and doing practice problems over and over.",poor
1052652,"Jone's textbook is probably one of the most confusing organic chemistry texts to read and follow.  You get much more out of reading Paula Bruice or Wade, and then go back to Jones.   He does follow the sequence in the text though. Lecture room crammed.  Hard to see writing on board. Otherwise a good lecturer. My TA cannot respond to &#63;s in english",poor
1052652,"LOVE HIM.  The class is challenging, but a lot of students make it harder than it actually is.  MJ asks a lot of his students, but he's clear about what he expects, and he's engaging, wickedly funny, bombastic, and surprisingly sprightly for his age.  Read the book, do the problems he suggests, take LOTS of notes in lecture--you'll actually learn!",awesome
1052652,Professor Jones is a very good professor. He is famous in the world or chemistry but he doesn't let that feed his ego. His pace is a little quick but keeping up with the book definitely helps.,good
1052652,"Yes, Jones is a brilliant amazing genius and all that... great... but when he lectures he goes off on tangents of whatever planet he's on and its hard to follow. Orgo 1 was very manageable, but during orgo 2 he went nuts. I can't say the tests werent fair but the grading is AWFUL!!! U never know what theyre looking for!!!!! TAs are awful as well",poor
1052652,"Many people hate Jones, but its because they don't study. You HAVE to read his textbook and you HAVE to go to class. Memorize every problem in the back of each chapter. Jones is an awesome professor and a really cool guy... you just have to stop expecting to know stuff without actually studying it.",good
1052652,His tests aren't hard if you study. He is intimidating but is very helpful.,awesome
1052652,"exams are written to discourage as many as possible. Prof. holds no office hours, surprising considering orgo may be just the hardest undergraduate introductory course that exists. Book is written for graduate students going for their phd",awful
1052652,"jones knows his stuff and the course is good overall but make sure you get a decent TA and go to reviews if they are held. i found them more clear than lectures. also, do all the practice questions in the book.",average
1052652,"He's a cool guy but his book can be completely ridiculous and has way too many side notes. In class he's funny but it's hard to contact him outside of class for help because he never seems to respond to e-mails. It's nice because he loves organic chemistry and clearly wants to help you, but he needs to be more available to students.",average
1052652,"Jones is respected for his research not teaching.  Thus his way of teaching can be a little trifling.  However, the subject itself is beautiful and worth waking up at 6am for.  Organic Chemistry's reputation is marred by the influx of incoming pre-med students who fail to appreciate the spellbinding concepts.  Be open-minded and it will be easy.",average
1052652,"MJ is an amazing professor. he really got me interested in organic chemistry. his exams are challenging, but you know exactly what to expect, so no surprises. what can i say&#63; MJ IS organic chemistry!",awesome
1052652,"Great Professor. He makes the material clear and writes challenging tests to punish lazy and dumb people. If you meet anyone who complains about this class there is a 90 percent chance that they were not smart enough to take it. If you want to be challenged and learn a lot of interesting material, this is the man to see.",awesome
1052652,His new innovative methods of teaching keep me interested. He's a hard professor but he puts the work in. He will be idolized by many. He's great!,awesome
1052652,One of the few great professors at NYU. I enjoy his style of teaching much more than Fishman and if you read before class...you basically will know exactly what he is talking about. Students that complain basically don't open the book. Definately not impossible to get an A and a B is a piece of cake. MJ is a legend! Enjoy him while u can.,good
1052652,"Prof. Jones at first comes across as a sweet, enthusiastic man. As his student, however, you will find that he not only creates exams with the intention of discouraging as many students as possible, but he also is totally unavailable and assumes that you have 37 hours a day to devote to basking in the glory of his textbook. Chances are, you'll fail",poor
1052652,"His lectures are really interesting, and he has excellent mastery of the course material.  His tests are challenging, but if you do a lot of practice problems, you will do well.  The only improvement would be for him to vary the lectures more from what he has written in his textbook.",awesome
1052652,His lectures are amazingly clear. I love the way he teaches. He is my favorite professor so far.,awesome
1052652,"Hella of a good teacher, explains stuff.. but he needs to talk louder and write BIGGER! I love his outfit! (he has one lol) Good book, basically just read it and u'll be ready for lecture. Fishman's gone baby! lol His cis(ters) name is Hilary Lincoln Jones.. By the time ur done with orgo, u'll be living , breathing, and speaking orgo.. Good Luck",good
1052652,Great professor...Jones should teach the class himself so there is less confussion on exams. harsh grader but gives fair exams,awesome
1052652,"MJ is an awesome lecturer and knows exactly what he is talking about. It was a refreshing change from the typical bore of lectures. Hard course but putting time into it, you will do well. Listen in lecture because he definately gives hints for the exams. Overall great professor.",awesome
90863,"Dr. Martichuski is extremely insensitive. She treats you like you are an idiot if you don't understand something. She also only has office hours for 40 minutes a week, super rude in email, and made a girl cry in class. The two girls I have class with have failed her class once, and I am fighting to get by so I never have to take her again.",awful
90863,"I took gen psych in hs and received an A and then came to college and took it again and barely got a C. She goes off topic all the time and talks about weed all the time or religion. Her test do not reflect anything that we were taught in class or given for practice. Her clicker questions are pretty fair, but not on the test. DO NOT TAKE HER.",awful
90863,"For this psych stats class, ATTENDANCE IS A MUST! Professor Martichuski's LA's disagreed with her teaching method and exams so going to help for them this semester was extremely difficult. Get ready to teach yourself.",awful

90863,"Diane is awesome! She makes her lectures fun and interesting and even creates note outlines that you can print and take with you to class.

She has tests that make you think, but she prepares you with good study guides & practi",good
90863,I don't understand why everyone is giving her such negative reviews. Yes you have to read a little (the text book is online and you have the choice to listen) and go to the lectures her amazing humor makes class extremely interesting and it's not hard to pay attention. The tests are also online and open note making her class not very hard.,awesome
90863,"Class is based on 500 points, if you do bad on one thing you're screwed her lectures don't help if you want to do well you have to spend time on reading the textbook over and over.",poor
90863,"Dr. S-M does really know her stuff, but unless you show up to class every day, take detailed notes, and read the *entire* textbook, you WILL do poorly on the tests. Since it is a freshman level class, she seems more concerned with scaring freshmen into good study habits (by having dis-proportionally hard tests) than she is with the actual material.",poor
90863,Diane was a really fun professor. Her lectures are full of stories and go all over the place but it keeps lecture notes interesting.,awesome
90863,"Great at providing an interesting and relevant overview of psych. Entertaining lectures, never felt lost or bored.",good
90863,"Wonderful woman who works hard to help the students who want to learn, but you have to put in the effort. If you're looking for an easy A this is not the professor to chose, but if you're looking for someone to invest time into your future and teach things applicable to the 'real world' Diane is the prof for you. Also hilarious teacher/lectures.",awesome
90863,"I don't doubt that Diane knows her stuff, because she does. That's evident in her lectures, however she is so scatterbrained and all over the place with her lectures. Her slides are minimal and hard to follow. She does not do a good job of outlining important points in lecture. Made me not want to go to class or office hours.",poor
90863,"I go to lectures for the extra credit clicker points, but don't pay attention. Her lectures are pretty boring in my opinion. I usually study the day before the test by reading the text book and do pretty well(B+). The only homework is reading (if you actually do it) and experiments. Lots of extra credit.",awesome
90863,Dr. Martichuski is a fun teacher to have. Just take notes and you should be fine.,awesome
90863,"Martichuski is very funny. She kind of talks about potentially offensive things often, but she never insults anyone. Classes are super easy and she even provides study guides for your notes. She gives so much extra credit you'd have to try to fail. Clickers are the majority of your grade, so make sure you go. Over all, loved this class.",good
90863,Love this women as a teacher. Class is very interesting and she is super funny. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS UNLESS YOU LOVE TAKING HARD TESTS. Her tests are impossible to do well on unless you pay 107% attention in class and read the text book 7 times over. ,average
90863,"My college experience has worsened from this class. She speaks about irrelevant topics and decides to include her personal beliefs as if they are facts. Miss 4 on a test  C.

90863,"She told the class she hadn't taught Social Psych in a while, but she did a fantastic job. She really knows what she's talking about, and even incorporates current events into her lectures to help students better connect to the themes of the class. I thought she was also pretty hilarious. And she made the class super interesting. 1010.",awesome
90863,"There's no homework whatsoever. Tests are all multiple choice. Really easy class, especially if you took AP psych in highschool. Martichuski is hilarious and knowledgeable. ",good
90863,She sucks. If you miss one word she says in class your at risk for getting a test question wrong. You have to take more notes than whats just on her slides if you want to do well. Her assignments are easy and if you do them you will get 100 but her tests are purposely written to screw you over. I would not recommend taking this class with her.,average
90863,Test questions are much different then what she says they will be. Clicker questions are easy and tests are totally opposite. ,average
90863,"Martichuski isn't for the faint of heart. Her lectures are concise, though she can get off topic when she tells funny stories or anecdotes. She can be a tough grader, but her criteria is clear from day one. Reading the book is important for a good grade, but not necessary to pass. Lectures are a must. Her sense of humor isn't for everyone. ",good
90863,Lectures were entertaining but worthless. Lots of boring reading that was not discussed much in class. Especially bad  thing about her is how she plants politics into her lessons. She passed off some very political statements as if they were part of the lesson.,average
90863,"She is the worst professor I've had had, hands down. Her final was nothing like her other tests so be prepared to be in for a surprise. She is extremely rude and condescending. Her grading policy makes absolutely no sense. This is why so few people pass the class. ",poor

Sad, because I actually enjoyed the material!",awful

90863,"She knows the material inside and out but is terrible at explaining it. Slides are incomplete and jump around, and concepts on tests are impossible to study for and don't follow lecture.

90863,"The actions of Dr. Martichuski prove how the academic system is truly unfair. She gave me a low grade on my final exam essay and when i asked her why she said it was because i only provided 4 answers to the question instead of 10. There was no indication on the exam of how many answers to give, she said i should have just assumed.I got a C for that",poor

90863,She traumatized me for LIFE when it came to statistics and research class! She is intimidating and the class was really tough. She does not seem to care for the students who tries really hard to do well in this class.,average
90863,"I LOVED this class! She explained the material well and made the lectures very pleasurable. If you attend every class and recitation, pay attention, and get the 20 extra credit points that are available, you are bound to do well. Great class and I highly recommend her!",good
90863,"Yeah, not a huge fan. I got an A, but only because I got extra credit and didn't miss any classes or recitations. The tests suck enormously. There are so many vague and confusing questions. Bleh. But lectures are entertaining.",average
90863,"Diane is awesome!!!  She is always available to offer help and gives you everything you need to get an A in her classes.  If you don't get an A it's because you're lazy and incompetent.  She wants her students to succeed more than anything else, so she holds you to a high standard, but gives you everything you need to reach it.",awesome
90863,Great professor!!  First psychology class ever and loved it.  Love her enthusiasm for what she teaches..has great stories and makes everything clear.  Tests very easy as well!,awesome
90863,"I got an A in this class and I still was baffled by the grades I would get on her tests. Her tests lack clarity to the point that they seem purposefully deceitful and hostile. I have no difficulty with hard tests, but I want questions that strays less into the realm of subjectivity.",average
90863,"HATE this teacher. I took her for social and had to miss a test for an academic contest, and she made it SO difficult for me to take it early. Managed an A-. Year later in her stats class I had to miss a lot of class when a family member got a terminal illness. I got high grades on every test but I was going to fail based on attendance. Had to drop",poor
90863,Worst professor... EVER,awful
90863,"Just because she may not have a warm and fuzzy personality doesn't mean she's trying to trick you or make you fail.  She's very thorough in lecture.  Her tests are on EXACTLY what she covers in class.  She has tons of office hours.  Is she sugary-sweet&#63;  No.  But is she intelligent, quick witted, and enthusiastic about the material&#63;  Definitely.",awesome
90863,diane if you are reading this i hope for the sake of your future students that you start to put in a little more effort as a professor.  You are a smart lady but did not provide a single shred of assistance every one of the 4 or 5 times i came up to you after class.  It seemed like you really just didnt care.,poor
90863,"Great teacher, made this topic tolerable and even a little fun. Did not own book, but managed to do all the HW just fine, which means she explained the material in a practical way and provided all the info needed to learn. Pros are: fun, energetic, organized, fair, caring. CONS: Notes are light, concept tests are HARD and confusion. Tests feel 80's",awesome
90863,"Avoid at all costs, unless you are an over achiever.  I recieved two A's on exams, and because I never came to class, she felt the need to average them out with two D's.  She takes off way too many unneeded points if she feels you are doing too well, while not coming to her class.",poor
90863,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. She tries to trick you on tests  and does not explain the information very well. She likes to tell stories instead of explaining the information. If you take the same class with Berta or King you WILL get a better grade.,poor
90863,Mind numbing lectures.  Tends to go off on long personal rants.  Power point slides are outdated and boring.  You really need to be alert in this class to learn.  Exam questions often hinge on minute detail discussed in lecture.  Take PSYC 1001 from Brett King if possible.,good
90863,The best teacher I have had in Years.,awesome
90863,"amazing teacher, go to class get an A... very laid back personality and easy to get along with",awesome
90863,"If you don't know what mean, median and mode are when you start this class you should probably go back to middle school. This is the easiest class I have ever taken. I don't OWN or read the book. I go to class and do the homework on time (note: she gives you the answers to all of the homework problems before they are due - they are free points).",good
90863,"Stats and Research methods was definately something i had to work at but it wasn't as bad as i thought.  You HAVE to go to class and turn in homework.  Lab starts halfway through semester, and you have to go as well.  The first lab class will go over your head, but once you get it its basically all building off of itself.  I got an A-",good
90863,"Probably the hardest, most confusing class I've ever taken.  She moves extremely fast, teaches different methods and formulas than the book, and her tests are torture. never miss class, never miss lab, read every chapter, do every hw...now, is that too much to ask&#63;!",poor
90863,"Stats sucks, but her class makes it a little more bearable, lol. Go to lecture and lab!! If you do, you'll be fine. Kind of socially awkward prof but very passionate about the subject and genuinely nice and helpful-if you do the work.",awesome
90863,funny,awesome
90863,shes really funny and makes class interesting.. you have to read the book in order to get a remotely good grade on the exams,awesome
90863,"This class is definitely a challenge but the Prof. is very knowledgeable. Go to class and pay attention and the material will make more sense. Overall, a pretty good class",awesome
90863,"You have to do the work, but if you do, you will be fine. Don't skip any classes, and do all homework on time.",awesome
90863,"AVOID AT ALL COSTS. This is not comming from a student who failed and is taking it out on a website.this lady is cold blooded. mid terms had class averages such as 61 and she does NOT CURVE. she makes class unintresting and painful. your hw is not graded and you do not know if you do it correctly. worst teacher i have ever had, hands down",average
90863,"pretty tough class, about half the students dropped after the first test.  nice lady though.",good
90863,Her class was a lot of fun. She always had great stories to use as examples.,good
90863,she is terrible and very rude when you are in need of assistance,awful
90863,bad prof!!,average
90863,"She presents material in an easy, straight-forward manner.  She makes me laugh amost every class.",good
90863,made me wanna go to class to hear her funny little comments.  her outlines are the most helpful thing EVER and her tests are way easy.,awesome
90863,"Great prof, funny in class, yet still teaches the material well.",awesome
90863,"very thorough, helpful, and clear as possible.  Not COMPLETELY relatable",awesome
90863,"Very interesting, very very clear.  Everything is straightforward and nothing is sneeky.  Good teacher, good class.",awesome
90863,"A very interesting professor.  Thorough, but doesn't focus on just the minutiae.  Wears the craziest print clothing, and has a deep and abiding love for what she teaches.  All in all, pretty cool.",awesome

90863,"Diane was a great professor. Loved how she put the notes online, made it easy to follow along during lecture. Do the experiments early; it's worth it for the extra credit. Exams were fair; go over her old ones online because they're pretty similar. Great class!",awesome
90863,"good overall professor, take advantage of extra credit",good
90863,"She is a good prof, she is always energetic and happy to be teaching, very clear, lots of videos, clear powerpoint notes which are in an outline that you can print and use to study, or for notes.  There are also practice tests online and the tests are easy if you attend class. Extra credit opps too",awesome
90863,This class is easy...everything on the tests is on the outlines she gives you to take notes from lecture on.,good
90863,"Statistics is awful, but Martichuski makes it much more manageable, especially if you are not fond of math! She is so helpful and VERY ORGANIZED!! If you go to lecture and recitation you will be fine!",good
90863,"She's clear and especially effective considering the class was 410 people.  Go to the lectures and the class is easy.  She goes out of her way to supplement the lectures with videos, speaker panels, etc.",awesome

142825,"Patti is a phenomenal sociologist, but her classes aren't for the lazy. Deviancy in US Society was a hard class, especially exams, but if you read the book and take notes in lecture, it's passable. The TA's and ATA's are a valuable resource. Patti isn't that helpful, but that's what the TA's are for. Doing well in recitation helps a lot on exams.",good
142825,Rude and stupid hard tests. Not a nice person. ,awful
142825,"Definitely not an easy class, but you get a giant note card for very test to reference. Go to class, take notes, and put all your notes on the note card. I never actually studied, but i always made the notecard, and always did fine on the test. Also always do the homework. It comes in handy later.",awesome
142825,terrible teacher,poor
142825,"Avoid Adler at all costs. Her class is incredibly hard to follow, her power points provide no info, and the book is very hard to understand and read. Her exams and grading are also in some weird format that has to be perfect or you lose points on the test.",poor
142825,"If you are dedicated to working hard in this class, you will do well.  Not for lazy people looking for an easy A.",good
142825,"Patti is an incredibly intelligent and outgoing person, and an amazing professor. Her stories are entertaining and this was one class I actually looked forward to going to!",awesome
142825,I had the honor of taking Deviance in US Society. Using her real world research studies brings to life real & honest issues. Some of the subject topics may be non-standard. That which makes us uncomfortable isn't something to be afraid of or to be shunned from the classroom. These types of discussions allow people & societies to grow & progress.,awesome
142825,"Easily the realest, most interesting class I've ever taken. Patti is a fantastic professor and is very engaging. Lecture was always very funny and it was not a chore to attend like some are.",awesome
142825,This was one of my favorite classes its sad how the university no longer values academic freedom among their staff and forced her into retirement.,awesome
142825,Patti was one of the best teachers I've ever had! Her classes are captivating and interesting to listen to! It's unfortunate that the university has decided to part ways with her though. She was a really great teacher who knew her stuff!,awesome
142825,"This is Patti's favorite class and is extremely passionate about it. I never got bored in lecture, but it easy to get distracted in a 500 student lecture. Lecture slides consist of 50% of tests, textbook lists make up the other 50%. Read the textbook, make an organized test note card, and go to recitation to do well!",average
142825,"SUCH an interesting class! All we talk about is prostitutes and drugs. Patti is a great teacher- she's very funny and relatable. As long as you read and go to lecture, you will pass. Take Kathryn as your TA- she is so passionate and informative.",awesome
142825,"If you go to class, make a good notecard for the tests, and do all of the reading lists from the textbook there is no way you won't do well in this class, you just have to try and pay attention and be good at applying knowledge because the tests aren't multiple choice.",average
142825,"Very interesting class. However, you need to understand the test format and what they are asking to do well.  Your notecard is your life saver.  Patti is a wonderful professor, but don't skip this class.  It is not that hard to get an A in the class, just make sure your notecard is thorough and write super small.",average
142825,Patti is so awesome! Her class is truly interesting and she is quite a character herself. This is a tough course especially for students used to being tested by multiple choice exams.  She uses a short response and essay format for her exams which requires students to truly understand the material in order to succeed. An A is totally possible!,good
142825,Patti has been my favorite professor at the University of Colorado. She has a great way of making the class very interesting. I found the class fairly easy because of how interesting it was.,average
142825,Before taking this class I was mostly uninterested in studying Sociology. This class was a game-changer for me. I absolutely loved this class and found everything discussed interesting and applicable to the real world. Every student at CU should take this class!,awesome
142825,I had Patti for Deviance which is an amazing class! I thought it would just be another boring core class but i loved it! Patti is hilarious and you learn a lot of really cool information. Take this class if you can! You wont regret it and you'll have an awesome time laughing every time you're in her lecture! I loved Patti's class!,awesome
142825,Professor Adler is great! She is very knowledgeable and always keeps lecture interesting (you will NOT be bored.) She is really understanding and helpful. This class is a must take!!,awesome
142825,Patti is one of the best professors I've had at CU. She was great at lecturing and making things comprehensible. Everything we discussed in class was of importance. She was very good at using different examples in her lectures to help give you a better grasp on the concept or idea being discussed. I highly recommend taking a class of hers!,awesome
142825,"Great professor, wonderful sense of humor, someone who knows what they are talking about, applies the learning to real life.",good
142825,my favorite class at CU so far! Patti is an amazing professor and ties her own experiences into her teaching which makes the class even more interesting,awesome
142825,Best professor I have had in my college career. Most amazing class I have taken. I have never learned more in one semester. Dr. Adler has a true passion for teaching and is an absolutely amazing educator.,awesome
142825,Patti is one of the most influential and outstanding professors at the university of colorado. She takes a legitimate interest in students opinions and grades. She is at the same time hilarious as well as brilliant in her teaching abilities. I only wish more professors were like her.,awesome
142825,Patti is an awesome professor. She not only is able to relate class material to her students lives but she also is able to keep her students attention by keeping lectures and readinds interesting. I would tell my friends to take this class even though it is difficult. You will gain insight to your way of life,awesome
142825,Patti is an amazing teacher. She is a very engaging speaker and really makes it worthwhile to come to class. She is easily one of the best professors that I have had at CU. I have taken two classes with her and plan on taking as many more as I can. She's awesome!,awesome
142825,"Patti is a great prof, with a super interesting class. with that said in no way shape or form is this an easy class. This should be a upper division class, and that amount of time and effort you put into this class will blow your mind when you get the test and still know nothing on it. DO NOT take her lightly! she runs a hard class!",poor
142825,Patti's Deviance in US Society class is a HUGE undertaking. Lots of reading. Going to class and doing the reading will not get you an A in the class. Overall a bit too much for an intro class.,good
142825,"Patti Adler is not the ideal professor. She is rude, and also makes HER books that she wrote mandatory and you are unable to sell them back--and their rather pricey. The TAs do all the work, most of the learning takes place in the labs. Her exam format is awful and notes are not posted and hard to follow. I don't recommend this class.",awful
142825,"Lots of reading, but not too difficult class if you keep up with the work. Plus, Patti's entertaining as hell.",good
142825,Very fun and interesting class! The stories and readings are very interesting as well!,awesome
142825,"This class is challenging, but if you are able to do the reading and attend class you will do fine. Make sure you fill out the notecards for every exam. Patti shares very personal, interesting, and relevant stories during lecture, you must attend",awesome
142825,The first test is going to scare the crap out of people but you really got stick with it because it gets easier! And the first test always has a huge curve! Her lectures are entertaining and MANDATORY. You will fail the test if you do not go to lecture. Bring laptop to take notes in class. Way too hard to get everything if you hand write,good
142825,I honestly thought this class would be fun! I was right until the first exam came along. The exams ARE HARD HARD HARD. I read all the material and still got a BAD grade. Patti makes her exams too hard for a 1000 level course. The lectures are fun buuuuuut the most common grade in the class is a D and not worth taking (in terms of your GPA).,poor
142825,"Teacher is the CRAZIEST! She is very interesting and I loved going to every class. However, the tests are completely essay and a bit difficult. But if one utilizes their note card right the tests can seem super easy! I recommend this class!",average
142825,Her tests are extremely hard and take way too long. She makes the TAs take points off for the dumbest things. If you take the class APPLY ONLY. DO NOT DEFINE! I made that mistake and got practically no points on one portion of the test all because I applied and defined. She knows her stuff but doesn't teach it very well.,poor
142825,Fun teacher. There is so much information packed into the course it became too much at times. I wish it slowed down and that Patti would explain things better. I really enjoyed the class though and the different types of prostitutes class down by the T.A.'s was hot,poor
142825,"One of the craziest professors you will ever meet. you allowed a note card on exam days, however every exam that i took went for 3-4 hours.",average
142825,"I absolutely HATED this class!  She's so weird, her tests were INSANELY hard, I spent $80 on her book that I can't sell, and I honestly got NOTHING out of taking this class other than a C on my transcript and I am a student that typically gets A's and B's.  If you're considering taking this as an elective, I suggest you find another class!",awful
142825,"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  I took this class as an elective and barely got away with passing and it really brought down my GPA. The tests are ridiculously hard, especially the first one because the TAs are really unclear about what kind of things they expect in your answers.  Taking this class was one of the worst decisions I've ever made.",awful
142825,Patti is great! She tends to get off topic a little bit but she knows what she's talking about and gets the point across really well. Her tests are pretty hard but as long as you put all of the notes from lectures and recitation on your notecard you'll do well. GO TO CLASS!!!,good
142825,"Lectures were exciting and Pati was very knowledgeable, but the tests were way harder than they needed to be. It's a 1000 level course, get over yourself.",good
142825,Lectures are awesome. Honestly the most gruesome tests on campus. Each test the fastest kid leaves after 2 1/2 hours and the last kid after 4 hours. FOR A MIDTERM!! Hard class because the tests are really hard even though you do get a 5x8 notecard,good
142825,This class was such a waste of time! Tests were really hard and they were all about applying definitions from her book which you'll never care about again once the test is over.  The only sort of good thing about this class was her ridiculous lectures.  She's one strange woman. I do not understand why this class is so popular!,poor
142825,"This woman has done too many drugs. She is funny on occation- but not what alot of ppl build her up to be. horrible at getting to the point. I dropped deviance in society cause it got ridiculous- YOU HAVE TO READ her whole book, attend lecture, and study your hooha off to get B! Good material-but not worth it. DID I MENTION THE TESTS ARE DEVIENT&#63;",awful
142825,"Best class, never wanted to miss it. If your interested at all in deviant behavior and a fun learning experience, she is it!",good
142825,"READ THE BOOK. this will help immensely on tests and if you read, you wont need to memorize cuz the material in the book is so interesting that its going to be embedded in your head. definitely go to lecture. she makes class fun and interesting with her insane analogies and presentations.",average
142825,"Patti is AMAZING! She is  crazy, wild teacher, but is so interesting, you will never want to miss class! Exams can be tough, but if you go to class, you will do just fine.",awesome
142825,"Patti is hilarious and her class is a lot of fun. If you can catch the stuff that she says in class,can understand her(she tends to talk really fast), and take good notes both in class and in resitation, you can get a decent grade in her class. Plus, she's just interesting to listen to.",average
142825,Plan on spending many hours studying for her tests. Be prepared to memorize INSANE amounts of information that you will inevitably forget soon after because it is all about memorization rather than understanding the concepts. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.,awful
142825,everyone on this thing is out of their mind. Patti had a good class and it wasn't that hard as long as you showed up to recitation and lecture. Take this class if you want an easy b or a,good
142825,This class was completely useless. Tests are 3-4 hours long and very subjective. The book can't be sold back because she writes new editions. You need to attend and take notes at every lecture and rec. because a lot wasn't covered in the book and the test is on EVERYTHING. Her lectures are enjoyable but are all writing.,poor
142825,"The concepts in the class are simple, but useless to try to learn. Completely a regurgitation class, but you have to go to EVERY class and write EVERYTHING she says in the order she says it. Copying the notes of the board isn't enough, you need to copy what she says. If you are just trying to complete a core requirment - dont take this.",poor
142825,"This has to be the worst class i have taken at CU. Every time we go to class we get a whole bunch of lists that just make a simple topic more complicated and less intresting.  The tests are obserdly long and the people who have enough will power to get through the test with out losing their mind are the only ones to do good, there are not many.",poor
142825,I think of this woman as comparable to Hitler.,poor
142825,Could have been interesting but turned out to bea bunch of stupid lists.,poor

142825,good,awesome
142825,"Patti Adler is a self-absorbed egomaniac, her Deviance class is filled with Patti's life accomplishments interspersed with wacked out theories and an occasional swear word--which is only entertaining to the inexperienced freshmen.  I left class with nothing more than writer's cramp from the four hour exams--its a 1000 level class, get a grip lady!",awful
142825,Hardest tests EVER! You get to take in a notecard but its not like a cheat sheet since the questions are all situations that test conceptual knowledge. Differences between different terms are minute and she definitely picks out the difficult discrepencies to test on in her questions. GREATEST CLASS EVER! Everything is both interesting and useful.,good

142825,hardest tests i have ever taken,average
142825,"Patti is hands-down the most amazing professor I've ever had. The tests test you on conceptual knowledge, and she let FA06 use a notecard on the exam, so it's not all about memorization. It's about understanding. She's a genuinely nice woman with incredible knowledge and a fantastic sense of humour. I will keep in touch with her for a long time.",awesome
142825,"deviance is all textbooks, exams are very annoying to study for and they take forever to take but she grades easily. its too much work to take as an elective but shes like no other teacher in boulder.",poor
142825,"I ended up HATING this class. Her tests are memorizing a bunch of pointless lists. Her TA's graded sooooo hard. The guy took off points left and right b/c I didn't say exactly what he wanted me to. I should have complained. Should have fought the unfair grading more. But I didn't, and now my GPA suffers. I would never EVER recommend her.",poor
142825,She's alright,average
142825,Took Social Deviance w/ Adler.  Entertaining lectures.  Heavy reliance upon tests for total grade.  Much memorizing.  Very interesting book; easy to read.

Occasional frustrating confusion about what is desired on a test -- different input from different TA's = questionable,good

142825,"Patti was one of the best professors I had in college.  She is hilarious... sometimes you laugh with her, sometimes you laugh at her.  Her class keeps you on your feet.  One day we spent the entire hour talking about deviant sexual fetishes.  and you've gotta love the teaching assistants dressing up like prostitutes.  Patti rocks!",awesome

142825,This class was great. The tests were based on memorizing lists.  I would study for a few hours the day before and I got an A in the class.

142825,"The class was really fun and interesting, but the tests were ridiculous with tons of memorizing. I took the class just as an elective, but it did end up bringing down my GPA. It really depends on how much effort you're willing to put into it",good
142825,She is awesome and really entertaining.,awesome
142825,"Adler tells some funny stories, but her tests are insanely hard, and the grading on assignments is about as harsh as it gets. Definitely not worth it, and especially not worth it for me, because I took her class 4fun and now its bringing down my gpa!",poor
142825,Patti is very knowladgeble and a great professor. She has a crazy sense of humor and makes the class extremely entertaining.,good
142825,She is really wierd and crazy,good
64144,"His lectures are long and he makes simple concepts confusing through bad examples. The online portion is messed up, I did practice questions and ones I left blank ended up going against my grade. His grading is ridiculous, I was .2 away from an A, and the online factors I didn't know about and wasn't on the syllabus made me get a B. DO NOT TAKE HIM",awful
64144,Lectures and are really long and boring. Test are hard.,poor
64144,"I'm about to finish up microecon with Graves and so far it's been fairly easy. I went to a total of four lectures (2 of which were the midterms) and I have an A in the course. As long as you read the book and go to recitation, you will be fine. Tests can be tricky for a lot of people but he curves the hell out of them.",good
64144,I may be biased because this material comes to me fairly easy but I thought he did a great job teaching the course. My advice would be to not miss class. Lots of anecdotes that I thought kept the class from becoming monotonous. Think I'll try and minor in Econ because of the course.,awesome
64144,Most people are probably gonna rate him poorly but I think his class was great. At the very least he is entertaining. His lectures weren't great but you will learn if you can pay attention unlike 95% of the class.,good
64144,"NOT a good professor, super boring not my best choice at all. Tests are super tough so read your little heart out.",poor
64144,"Fantastic teacher. Logical as hell. Great grading system. Rambles in class about sometimes off topic material, but very interesting guy without a doubt. Highly recommend this teacher to anyone wanting to pass Microeconomics. You do not have to attend, DON'T so everyone who does gets better grades. Very competitive curve, 75 avg.",good
64144,"Professor Graves tests are quite difficult as they are littered with trick questions. He does curve it based on the overall class average, but you will find it hard to pass if you blow off his class. READ THE BOOK it will save your grade.",average
64144,"Grave's lectures are incredibly long and make you want to fall asleep. He over complicates simple concepts with a ton of useless, drawn out examples. His tests are very tricky too; The second midterm has a class average of a 53 but he curves like a madman. Reading your textbook will save your semester, STAY CLEAR OF THIS PROF.",poor
64144,"Horrible lectures including topics completely non-related. Tests are ridiculous. None of the homework correlates with the midterms. Terrible teaching.   Midterms are multiple choice meaning that if you miss five you get an 80, and lets face it no one can miss just five. Every average ends up a failed grade so why does Graves continue with this???",awful
64144,Good teachers. Tests just like the practice ones;,good
64144,"First off, I would definitely not recommend taking any course with Graves. Online homework has no correlation to tests so studying is very tough. He makes his own presentations which are not related to the homework, textbook or tests so good luck doing even 'decent' with this confusing teacher.",poor
64144,"The textbook he uses is very difficult to follow and is completely different than the Aplia homework but it is easier to follow than his lectures. Graves loves economics and knows it very well that he assumes that an intro class should be easy. Midterms are ridiculously hard, probably 10x the hw. Average midterm grade was a 53%, take a diff prof",poor
64144,"Phil is a legend. His lectures are all on point and he keeps you engaged the whole class. He is often behind and gets distracted easily, but he is hilarious. Also its an entry level econ class, you could have a monkey teach it and learn the same thing from a professor that has been teaching their entire career. Phil Graves is a definite must take.",good
64144,"Gets off track way too easily, in addition to having very long winded and monotonous presentation of topics",awful
64144,"Graves loves what he does and you can tell, but it was hard for him to explain something simple, he tends to get very off track to the point you don't want to go to lecture and think you can teach yourself (you can't). His tests are difficult because they have nothing to do with the homework. Be careful of TAs, hit or miss.",poor
64144,Graves was behind on his lectures the whole semester. Our TAs would assign online homework each week but the things that the homework covered were not even close to what he was lecturing us on that week. Make sure to read the textbook too because the book won't try to make stupid jokes and actually make you understand the material.,poor
64144,He takes forever to explain something simple. He gets off track sometimes. ,awful
64144,Lectures in class were only tangentially related to the material in the book. I had to keep cross-referencing because the chapter headlines in my notes didn't match up with the material in the book. Don't assign a book if you're not going to use it. Tests seemed to draw more from microeconomics than the material we learned in class. No homework.,average
64144,Tests are so hard and do not cover any of the material learned in class 'don't expect to get higher than a 60' as he says...,poor
64144,"Extremely nice and funny guy, however his lectures are boring and throughout the semester many people stop showing up as lectures are not mandatory. Online assignments are challenging, but as long as you read the book and show up to recitations the class is fairly easy",average
64144,"Lectures are very long and easy to become bored, but not mandatory. As long as you read through the book, his power points online, and study with his practice tests, you should do fine. Funny guy, very chill.",good
64144,"Phil is a pretty cool guy, but you really need the book to do well. I pretty much relied on it all semester because his lectures can be long and boring and my TA barely spoke english. I read the book, did the assignments and studied and was still able to pass with an A",average
64144,"Awesome thing about this class is if you do well on the first two midterms you don't have to take the final. Hardly ever went to class, but still got out of the midterm. You just have to actually read the text book and do the weekly assignments. Sure this gets annoying but its not a big price to pay for never having to go to class. Graves is cool 2",good
64144,"You have an assignment every week, and it does not help you what so ever with what you are learning. His lectures are long, and some what hard to follow.  In order to even receive a C in his class you have to put in around 20+ hours of work.",poor
64144,"Great professor IF you already know and are interested in ECON. He knows his stuff. Lectures are boring if you've never taken ECON or not very interested in it. For his tests and midterms, make sure you do his old tests posted on his website. Very helpful!",good
64144,"Graves knows econ and has the ability to explain it well by using real life examples. Most kids in his class won't get an A, however that's because of the people in the class. He will answer questions you have and is generally a nice guy. ",awesome
64144,If you like convoluted explanations of relatively easy ideas and terribly worded test questions than Graves is the guy for you.  The best advice I have is to read your text book.  That is unless you like the idea of learning things as simple as brushing your teeth in terms of quantum physics in a foreign language. ,poor
64144,"Graves is an awesome person. I've gone into many of his office hours and had a few one on one meetings with him and I couldn't say a bad thing about him as a person. On the other hand his class is way too long, lectures are boring and hard to stay focused in. Homework and quizzes are not terribly hard, but the tests are impossible!!!!",average
64144,"Although his lectures are way too big, he makes a point to make sure he explains things in a way that most students can understand. His office hours are helpful. On exams, as long as you have done the homework and taken notes, you should do fine. He words his questions a little confusing but they are fairly easy.",average
64144,"Graves seems to understand the material for sure, but the class is 10Xs larger than it should be. Very very watered down and he writes very confusing tests.",poor
64144,NEVER TAKE HIS CLASS! Super disorganized and rude. Is a really hard grader,awful
64144,"Lectures with powerpoint, pretty funny and engaging. Has relatable examples and class attendance is worth it. The Powerpoints only supplement his lecture, which he does on his own and you can tell he really knows the material. Occasionally not very clear on some points, but main points are strongly enforced.",good
64144,"Phil knows Micro like the back of his hand & wants everyone else to know it too. Phil is a approachable prof. His lectures are done on an overhead projector, allowing him to deviate from the lesson. His tests are full of trick questions. Does not assign textbook readings. If you don't have previous Micro knowledge, your GPA will suffer.",average
64144,"Incredibly smart guy! Uses good examples. But VERY unorganized and is very difficult to understand the concepts the way he explains them. The only reason I got a good grade was because I went to another teacher's class, as well, to actually understand the information. Otherwise I would have gotten a bad grade even though I read the book.",poor
64144,"Pretty interesting professor, funny at times. Uses a lot of interesting real world examples. Exams are harder than you'd expect but reading the textbook he wrote is very helpful",awesome
64144,"probably one of the funniest profs. loves his opinions, some are offensive, but i find that funny. if you go in for help with the paper he gets real excited, he loves talking about who knows what. missed lots of classes. took little notes. study old midterms. he basically tells you what questions will be asked but changes the words to trip you up.",good
64144,Awesome Professor. Really funny.,awesome
64144,Microeconomics- The man absolutely knows his stuff. It is a tough class but he uses interesting examples and introduces concepts relevant to everyone. Class is difficult if econ isn't your thing. Can't wait to take environmental econ with him!,awesome
64144,Graves is very helpful and knows tons about the material. If you have a real interest in econ take his class,awesome
64144,Most unorganized person I have ever taken a class from.  His exams do not test you on what you have learned...they are just trick questions.  He seemed uninterested in the class and the success of his students.  I was initially excited about this class and came away very disappointed.,poor
64144,"If you've taken BCOR finance and ethics this course is a breeze. Graves talks about discounting cash flows a bunch, and a lot of his arguments are fairly easy to understand. I feel like I learned a lot. He teaches simplified models that help explain why pollution occurs and why it's so hard to measure and control. Great elective for business kids.",good
64144,"This is not an easy class and it is different from other microeconomic class. If you have zero economic background, it will be very difficult for you. The textbook does not explain everything. You have to learn almost everything on your own. The recitation does not help to prepare for the test. You have to figure out the concept from somewhere else",poor
64144,Class is confusing. Tests are the essentially the exact same ones he has used previously. Do not expect to learn anything from this class,poor
64144,Best economic teacher at CU hands down.,good
64144,"Phil was my graduate advisor. While I had to go elsewhere for very technical econometric questions, Phil was the master at teaching me to think like an economist. A much harder to quantify skill than showing me how to do regressions, but vital none the less.",awesome
64144,"Definitely could not understand lectures except for the jokes, which were funny. reading the book and looking over past exams = success. some things arent in the book and are in lecture so at least just copy down everything he write on the overhead.",poor
64144,"very hard professor, taught myself the entire class because i couldnt understand the lectures at all. READ before you come to class, it makes more sense. get tutors. nice curved grading scale but need to work very hard to succeed. tests are killer and 100 percent of your grade",awful
64144,"Graves' micro economics class was unorganized and difficult to follow.  The class was based more off of his environmentalist opinions than off of any principles. All that counts is tests, and they cover EVERYTHING.",awful
64144,"Phil Graves knows how to party. However, he doesn't really know how to teach intro micro so it can be understood.",poor
64144,I took micro economics. He doesn't care about attendance or book reading. Almost everything depends on the exam. If you know the material it's not a super hard exam. But you do need to learn everything he's talking about. His exams covers it all.,awesome
64144,"Study the old midterms, and look through the book. AND don't fall into the trap of thinking he's trying to trick you with his questions - pick the most obvious answer (usually E). The questions are all really similar, every semester.",average
64144,"&quot;The organization of the political system is similar to the organization of a septic tank, the largest chunks float to the top&quot;. P. Graves, 2008.  Funny dude & strong defender of his sometimes spurious/pointless arguments.  Best class to nap through. Worse part of class were the defiant self-entitled environmentalists. If in doubt, choose E",good
64144,"Horrible professor, makes no sense in class.  No wonder other economists don't understand his theories.  Tests are unfair.",awful
64144,ahhhhhhhhh!!!!!,average
64144,"Go to class for the first few sections (like Supply and Demand stuff) but the rest can be learned in recitation. Also, if you don't get the topic, GO ASK HIM!! even if he's not so helpful in class, it will be 100% more clear if you go to his office hours!",good
64144,"Graves sure loves to talk about random things.  That said, if you come to class and read the textbook you will do well in that class.  The TAs aren't much help, but thats not his fault.  Much easier than other econ professors for this course!",good
64144,Graves is awesome.  If you are taking prin. of microecon take it with graves! his lectures are very clear and thorough.  Tests aren't very hard and if you do good you dont have to take the final.  Much better than other econ 2010 professors,awesome
64144,"He mumbles to himself about useless stories like how he likes Jodi Foster and Yager. The only reason I'm surviving his class is because I have THE ONLY teaching assistant who speaks comprehensive english (the rest hardly speak english, more chinese).",awful
64144,Very good professor. Helpful and understandable. Well organized notes. One of the only professors ive had the truely wants to see every student succeed. very refreshing in contrast to most professors and TA's who feel that being an ass is what they are there for.,awesome
64144,Graves is awesome to listen to and as a professor he makes the tests short and simple.  He also forms your grade to give you the best possible final grade.,awesome
64144,His lectures fill graves. I just had to log in to say that.,poor
64144,No Comments,good
64144,"The notes barely relate to the tests, as the tests are extremely hard. Most of the answers are E, or when he says &quot;a or c&quot; that is usually the answer. He is a nice guy and he is smart, but he is just a very bad teacher. There are only 2 tests and a final, so your grade can be very low or very high",average
64144,"he's sort of a funny/crazy guy, which makes lectures somewhat more tolerable, yet hard to follow and the class notes don't make much sense, but if you're good at learning on your own from the book you'll probably do well (the amount of material isn't overwhelming or too hard to grasp). as well as he has a very fair grading policy.",average
64144,"I feel that Phil Graves gets a bad rap.  He is far too intelligent to be teaching basic Economics classes to immature college students.  He has a hard time creating enthusiasm for the subject unless you are already interested in it and the people who speak badly of him are there to try and get by with an easy grade.  However, if you pay attention to the lectures or just the notes, an A is easy to obtain.  I missed a lot of class and got an A for two different classes of his.  He is on the cutting edge.",awesome
64144,Easiert math-related class of my life!,average
64144,Graves writes the most impossible test about things that don't even make any sence,awful
64144,"He was a really interesting and funny guy with a lot of good examples of microeconomics. If class wasn't at 9:30, it would have been better. The tests are ridiculous with 2 midterms with 20 questions each...that means each question is worth 5% of your grade. It's really easy to do poorly on the tests, but you can do well if you try",poor
64144,Worst professor and class ever.,poor
64144,"Graves is harder the other econ profs I've had, but go to class and pay attention and you'll get an A. I never went to recitation and managed that. He just makes you think in a different way.",good
64144,Graves' class is signifigantly harder than any other econ teacher. GET OUT while u CAN!!,poor
64144,"Phil goes on so many tangents! It is impossible to take notes and then he goes off on the math of how to do things which make no sense. He is occasionally funny and very intellegent, but yeah not so great at the teaching thing.",average
64144,"He suffers from emotional breakdowns frequently, prompting all other econ professors to look at you with great pity when you mention you took him. Wonderful class, if you are interested in learning about inflated housing prices in Malibu, CA and red wine.",awful
64144,No Comments,good
64144,Such a bad bad class.,poor
64144,He was a funny guy but a horendous teacher. All i even remember about his class is him talking about beer and haagan das. oh and mc=mr,poor
64144,"Prof Graves is a very interesting man...if you enjoy hearing the sames stories about beer and 50 cent over and over again, I would recommend taking this class! Overall, his class is manageable",average
64144,"He's really disoriented, but a really cool guy and funny. A little hard to understand, but if you read the book, and go to recitation, its not that bad.",average
